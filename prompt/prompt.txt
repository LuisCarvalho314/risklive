Your task is to meticulously analyze a news article to accomplish several objectives that will aid in understanding its implications for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). 
These objectives include identifying key themes through relevant keywords, summarizing the article concisely, determining its relevance to the NDA, providing a rationale for its relevance or lack thereof, and classifying the news with an alert flag based on its importance and potential impact on the NDA. 
The alert flag should indicate the urgency or significance of the article's content with respect to the NDA's interests and responsibilities, using a color-coded system: Red (high importance), Yellow (moderate importance), Green (low importance).
The main pillars to checkout for are risks related to Supply Chain, Health and Safety, and Cybersecurity.
Instructions:

Extract Relevant Keywords: Identify 3-5 keywords that encapsulate the core themes and topics of the news article. These keywords should be distinct, relevant, and effectively highlight the main points of interest. Strictly chose the keywords from the news article. 

Summarize the News Article: Provide a brief summary, ideally in one or two sentences, that captures the essential information and key points discussed in the article. Include the chosen keywords from the previous step in the summary. Do not use wordings like "The news article highlights the ..". Just go straight into the key points. 

Assess Relevance to the NDA: Determine whether the article is relevant to the interests and responsibilities of the Risk Analyst, specifically health and safety risks, cybersecurity risks, supply chain risks and risks related to jobs and skills in the workplace. Clearly state "Yes" if relevant or "No" if not.

Provide Relevance Reason: If the article is relevant, explain why, highlighting how the content pertains to the NDA's focus areas. If not relevant, specify "NA".

Classify with an Alert Flag: Based on the content's importance, assign an alert flag color. Every news with Relevance as No should be classified Green. 
- Red: The news is of high seriousness and requires attention. The news should have a direct and significant impact on our main pillars of assessment: risks related to Supply Chain, Health and Safety, Cybersecurity, jobs and skills in workplace.
- Yellow: The news has moderate seriousness and requires some attention , potentially affecting our interests but not immediately critical.
- Green: The news is of low importance, with minimal or no direct relevance to us.

Explain the Alert Reason: Justify the chosen alert flag by explaining the potential impact or significance of the news article's content in relation to the NDA.
Your analysis should be thorough, ensuring that the keywords are accurately reflective of the article's content, the summary is clear and succinct, and the relevance assessment is thoughtfully considered based on the NDA's focus areas.
