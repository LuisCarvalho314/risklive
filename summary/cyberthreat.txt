Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and the UK is no exception. In 2021, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reported that there had been a 700% increase in ransomware attacks in the previous year. Ransomware attacks are when cyber criminals encrypt a victim's data and demand a ransom payment in order to decrypt it. These attacks can be devastating for businesses, as they can lead to loss of data, disruption to operations, and financial losses.
Supply chain attacks are another growing threat. In a supply chain attack, cyber criminals target a supplier to a company in order to gain access to the company's systems. This can allow the cyber criminals to steal data, launch attacks on the company, or even disrupt the company's operations. In 2021, the NCSC warned that supply chain attacks were a "significant and growing threat" to the UK.
State-sponsored attacks are also a concern. The UK government has warned that Russia is a "significant and persistent cyber threat" to the UK. Russia has been accused of carrying out a number of cyber attacks against the UK, including the 2020 SolarWinds hack. State-sponsored attacks can be very sophisticated and can be difficult to defend against.
Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure are also a concern. Critical infrastructure includes things like power grids, water supplies, and transport networks. Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure can have a devastating impact on the UK. In 2021, the NCSC warned that the UK was "increasingly vulnerable" to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.
The UK government is taking steps to address the threat of cyber attacks. The government has published a number of strategies and plans, and it has invested in new cyber security capabilities. However, the threat of cyber attacks is constantly evolving, and the government needs to continue to adapt its response.
