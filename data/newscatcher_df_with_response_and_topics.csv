New Gmail Rules Start Blocking Emails—In A Good Way,Davey Winder,2024-02-08 12:51:54,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/02/08/gmail-messages-blocked-as-google-dmarc-email-security-policy-enforced/,forbes.com,Gmail users have begun to report errors as new policy rolls out to make your email more secure. But what do these sender not authenticated messages mean?,"In an announcement by Google on October 3, 2023, Neil Kumaran, a group product manager responsible for Gmail security and trust, confirmed that starting February 2024, Gmail will require bulk senders to authenticate their email. As February has arrived, this policy is now in effect. Users have begun to report receiving Gmail errors, indicating that email has been blocked due to the sender's lack of authentication.

02/08 updates below. This article was originally published on February 6.

Gmail Attacker Loophole To Be Closed By New Google Policy

The October announcement, titled New Gmail protections for a safer, less spammy inbox, stated that users shouldn't need to 'worry about the intricacies of email security standards,' and instead be able to 'confidently rely on an email's source.' You won't find me complaining about that; it's bang on. From Google's end, the solution is to require all Gmail users who send 'significant volumes' to use a robust email authentication method to close what it calls 'loopholes exploited by attackers' that threaten all of us. All 1.8 billion of us, as that's how many Gmail accounts there are.

Authentication Errors Reported By Gmail Users

Seth Blank is chief technology officer at email domain validations platform Valimail and co-chair of the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance working group. As from the start of February, Blank warns, 'you will start to see temporary errors for unauthenticated mail, and starting in April, unauthenticated mail that does not pass DMARC will start to be rejected.' Blank was not wrong: those authentication failure messages are already being reported by users, and while temporary for now, the confusion they leave behind will likely be more long-lived. So, let's try to clear that up.

Google states that 'In February 2024, bulk senders who don't meet sender requirements will start getting temporary errors (with error codes) on a small percentage of their non-compliant email traffic. These temporary errors are meant to help senders identify email traffic that doesn't meet our guidelines so that senders can resolve issues that result in non-compliance.'

When 15 Billion Daily Blocked Emails And A 99.9% AI Spam Filtering Rate Are Not Enough

Google's Kumaran says that while Gmail AI stops more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware from hitting your inbox, including some 15 billion emails every day, that's not enough, which is why the new bulk email senders requirements have been implemented.

Firstly, Kumaran says, bulk senders are 'those who send more than 5,000 messages to Gmail addresses in one day.' Because many fail to secure their systems properly, malicious actors can hijack email domains for nefarious purposes. Sender validation and strong email domain authentication are essential in filtering out much of this security-weakening material. 'Last year (2022), we started requiring that emails sent to a Gmail address must have some form of authentication'' Kumaran says, 'and we've seen the number of unauthenticated messages Gmail users receive plummet by 75%.' This, in turn, led to less cluttered Gmail inboxes and billions of messages with malicious intent being blocked before delivery.

As well as the new bulk mail sending authentication requirements, Google has also enabled accessible unsubscription features for Gmail users. Google also implements a 'clear spam rate threshold,' so senders who break this are throttled. 'This is an industry first, and as a result, you should see even less spam in your inbox,' Kumaran confirmed.

What Do Gmail Unauthentication Errors Mean?

The best resource I have found for getting to grips with what these errors mean is from another email domain verification specialist, PowerDMARC. The operations team lead with particular expertise in email authentication and security, Yunes Tarada, breaks down a typical Gmail unauthenticated sender error message and explains precisely what it means. Tarada also explains that users sending less than 500 emails per day could also find their messages getting blocked by Gmail if they don't have Sender Policy Framework or DomainKeys Identified Mail implemented, a spam rate greater than 0.3%, no Transport Layer Security connection for transmitting emails, no Authenticated Received Chain enabled to forwarded messages, invalid DNS records or are impersonating Gmail from headers.

Expert Says Herd-Immunity For Bulk Email Is Required

Blank has been providing customer feedback directly to Google regarding the guidance to hopefully clarify what it means and help senders and recipients understand the authentication requirements. 'This isn't just about protecting yourself,' Blank says, 'done right, email authentication protects partners, consumers, and anyone receiving email.' Blank reckons that a herd-immunity percentage of 70% of the largest bulk email senders using string authentication must be reached to make exact domain spoofing 'economically uninteresting.'

'Just like we adapted to HTTPS as the standard for the World Wide Web, and like MFA is becoming the standard for our online accounts, every business will need to become familiar with standards like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC,' Gerasim Hovhannisyan, CEO at EasyDMARC, says. 'As we navigate the evolving cyber landscape,' Hovhannisyan continues, 'staying proactive in adopting and adapting to these security trends will be paramount for businesses to maintain effective communication channels and uphold their digital reputation.'

02/08 update: It's not just emails that are getting blocked by Google in an attempt to weed out spam and malicious activity. Google has just announced that it is trialing a new feature to block the side-loading of potentially malicious apps for Android users.

Eugene Liderman, the director of mobile security strategy at Google, says that as 'part of a continued strategic partnership with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore,' the company is to start piloting an enhanced fraud protection program for Android users in Singapore in the coming weeks. Liderman says that the enhanced fraud protection program has 'undergone testing by the Singapore government' and explains that it will work by analyzing and blocking apps that might otherwise abuse sensitive runtime permissions.

The analysis will be undertaken in the background when an Android user attempts to install an app from outside of an official Play Store environment. This could include using web browsers, messaging apps and file managers as an internet-side loading source, the Google announcement states. Specifically, the enhanced fraud protection pilot will inspect app permissions being declared in real-time and flag any of four runtime permissions, namely RECIEVE_SMS, READ_SMS, BIND_Notifications and Accessibility.

This is understandable as these are, Liderman says, 'frequently abused by fraudsters to intercept one-time passwords via SMS or notifications, as well as spy on screen content.' Google analysis of fraud malware families exploiting these runtime permissions suggests that '95 percent of installations came from Internet-sideloading sources.'

Developers are advised, Liderman says, to review device permissions being requested by their apps to ensure that the process follows the Android privacy best practices guidelines. The first item on the checklist is to minimize permissions requests. 'Your app should only request permissions that the app needs to complete an action,' Linderman says, 'and ensure it does not violate the Mobile Unwanted Software principles.' Google will provide tips to help fix any potential issues, and if an app has been blocked by the enhanced fraud protection program, an appeals system will be available. The main message from Google to developers is: 'Always ensure that your app does not engage in behavior that could be considered potentially harmful or malware.'

Chua Kuan Seah, deputy chief executive of Singapore's CSA, says 'The fight against online scams is a dynamic one. As cybercriminals refine their methods, we must collaborate and innovate to stay ahead.' Liderman concludes by assuring Android developers and Google users alike that 'we will be closely monitoring the results of the pilot program to assess its impact and make adjustments as needed.'",forbes.com,49,2,US,en,"Davey Winder,Senior Contributor",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64e7031f115ba4a1a14af6bb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,,35933e99104a19d8f67862f049d39052,"['Gmail', 'authentication', 'bulk senders', 'email security', 'spam']","Starting February 2024, Gmail requires bulk senders to authenticate their email, leading to authentication errors reported by users.

What to watch for at US supreme court oral arguments on keeping Trump off 2024 ballot,Cameron Joseph,2024-02-08 12:51:33,full,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/trump-us-supreme-court-14th-amendment,theguardian.com,"After Colorado ruled 14th amendment bars Trump from its presidential ballot, justices may be looking for a way out of case","You're reading the Guardian US's free Trump on Trial newsletter.

The US supreme court 
meets today to hear oral arguments
 on whether the 14th amendment of the constitution bars the former president 
Donald Trump
 from appearing on the ballot in Colorado and other states because of his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. The case is unprecedented: the clause has rarely been used since it became part of the constitution after the civil war in 1868, and it has never before been applied to a former president.
The oral arguments are expected to be something of a free-for-all, with nine justices asking about a bevy of unresolved constitutional issues. And the justices' questions on Thursday could hint at exactly how they might rule.
What they have been asked to decide is whether Trump should not be allowed to run for president because of section three of the 14th amendment, which says no one who has taken an oath to support the constitution – typically administered when elected officials are sworn into office – and goes on to engage 'in insurrection or rebellion' against the US, is allowed to hold public office again.
Many legal scholars and former government officials have made the case in briefs that the plain language of the amendment applies to Trump, but few expect the supreme court to, in effect, decide the 2024 election by disqualifying one of the main candidates. Court watchers suspect that they would rather not hear the case at all – and may seek to make as narrow a ruling as possible.

'I don't think [the court] wants to be involved in these disputes,' the University of Notre Dame law professor 
Derek Muller
 told the Guardian's 
Sam Levine
 in his 
excellent preview
 of the hearing. 'I think, on a bipartisan basis, there's an interest on staying as far away from these issues as possible.'
What court watchers will be listening for especially is whether any of the justices show any interest in any of the possible legal off-ramps identified by Trump's lawyers and legal scholars based on the semantics of the 14th amendment's text. Here's a quick guide to what they might be talking about:
● 
'Officer' –
 Trump's legal brief in the case spends a lot of its time arguing that the term 'officer of the United States' in the 14th amendment does not apply to the presidency.
● 
'Insurrection' – 
Another argument in the Trump brief is whether his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results amount to the sort of rebellion the amendment's authors had at the time. Trump has also argued that his actions on that day do not meet the definition of 'engaged in'.
●
'Self-executing' – 
Another argument, which has come up in the few times the section 3 has been considered in the past, is that Trump cannot be disqualified unless Congress acts to. The Colorado supreme court found that the section is 'self-executing', that is it does not require legislative action for the courts to apply.
If the justices spend a lot of the oral arguments discussing Trump's actual conduct on and before the January 6 Capitol riot, that might be a sign they may actually address the issue at the heart of the case.

The Guardian US Washington bureau chief, 
David Smith,
 
takes a close look
 at how one of the 
briefs
 filed in this case was
 
intentionally designed to appeal to the conservative justices who have been deciding major cases such as abortion and gun rights using 'originalist' readings of the US constitution – the theory that constitutional issues should be interpreted as they would have been in the era they were written.
The left-leaning non-profit Public Rights Project used historians to craft their brief, heavily citing the Senate debate on adopting the 14th amendment just after the US civil war. They make it clear that the senators believed the provision would not only apply to former Confederates but to the leaders of future rebellions, as well.
'Our goal was to bring an originalist historical perspective to the supreme court as it considered the meaning of section 3 of the 14th amendment,' Jill Habig, the head of Public Rights Project, told the Guardian. 'The point we make with our historian colleagues is that the history of section 3 is actually very clear. It demonstrates that section 3 was intended to automatically disqualify insurrectionists.'

On Tuesday, a three-judge panel issued a ruling that 
eviscerated all of Trump's claims
 that as president he had 'absolute' immunity from criminal prosecution. The scathing 57-page opinion from three judges on the DC circuit court of appeals systematically knocks down his lawyers' arguments – and just might put the timeline of the federal January 6 trial in DC back on track.
'We cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a President has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power,' the judges wrote. 'For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump.'
Trump unsurprisingly suggested he will appeal, declaring 'SAVE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY' in a 
post
 on his Truth Social website after the decision dropped.
The judges also included an order in their decision that is meant to speed the case along: the panel gave Trump until just Monday, 12 February, to ask the supreme court to overturn their decision and put the case on pause. They also cut off one potential stalling technique for Trump by also ruling that if he does ask the entire circuit court to rehear his immunity claim, which he has the legal right to do, the trial will not stop.

Judge Tanya Chutkan
 paused the trial proceedings on 13 December for the immunity appeal, about three months ahead of her scheduled trial start date of 4 March, and officially 
announced late last week
 that the trial would be rescheduled. It will take about three months for those pre-trial proceedings, so if Trump did not appeal (which he will) the trial's original timeline would put a start date in early May.
While no one expects the supreme court to overturn the case if Trump seeks review, they do have a fateful decision to make regarding the case's timing. There are three possible outcomes:
 
They could decline review or affirm the appeals court decision stand, which would put the trial on track for late spring or summer;
 
They could take it up on an expedited basis – as they did the 14th amendment case – which would delay the trial but still give it a good chance of happening before the election;
 
Or, they could take it up under normal procedures, essentially pushing the trial past the election, since the earliest the supreme court might rule would be June.


Just four of the nine justices would need to want to consider the case. The appellate judges' comprehensive opinion seems designed to encourage the first outcome.

Judge Arthur Engoron
 missed his self-imposed deadline to rule in the New York business fraud case by the end of January. He has already ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud by inflating the values of properties in financial documents, all that is to be decided are the civil penalties. On Monday, Engoron asked the trial's lawyers to give him more information about a 
potential plea bargain
 that the former Trump Organization executive 
Allen Weisselberg
 is reportedly negotiating with the office of the Manhattan district attorney, 
Alvin Bragg,
 in the separate hush money criminal prosecution in which he would admit to committing perjury. Engoron wants to know if Weisselberg plans to admit 'he lied under oath in my courtroom at this trial'; if so, Engoron may toss out all of Weisselberg's testimony as not credible.
In their response briefs, both prosecutors and Trump's defense urged Engoron not to delay his decision. Prosecutors said they were unaware of any negotiations with Weisselberg and argued he 'lacks credibility' in any case , while Trump's defense called the reports of a plea bargain 'speculative'.

From Soil To Satellite: Five Ways IoT Will Impact Modern Agriculture,Przemek Szleter,2024-02-08 12:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/from-soil-to-satellite-five-ways-iot-will-impact-modern-agriculture/,forbes.com,"AgriTech engages solutions within multiple technology departments, including AI, machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT).","Przemek Szleter is the founder and CEO of DAC.digital, with over 16 years of professional experience as a business & IT executive.

Agricultural technology is an ever-important branch of development across technologies. AgriTech is a significant part of various initiatives in Europe and around the globe. AgriTech engages solutions within multiple technology departments, including AI, machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The numbers show that IoT's significance is constantly growing, reaching $544.38 billion in 2022, and experts suggest that it can expect a further surge in growth to $2,227.00 billion by 2028 at an annual growth rate of 12.57%. Current trends show that the IoT market size in agriculture can grow from $11.4 billion in 2021 to $18.1 billion by 2026.

Let's find out the role of IoT in the future of modern agriculture.

How The IoT Will Impact Modern Agriculture

1. Sensing Capabilities In Precision Farming

Precision farming (or precision agriculture) may be one of the most critical IoT applications, even though it's not the most popular. Amid a food crisis, these innovations can contribute to increasing yields and anticipate difficulties to help counteract them, based on data analysis. Predicting and reacting to conditions quickly is essential for farming's efficiency and profitability.

IoT can offer multifaceted analysis of farming processes, including crop and cattle management, weather conditions, soil quality and staff performance. This comprehensive data collection clarifies the farm's progress and development, allowing for more informed decision-making. Moreover, adopting IoT can significantly contribute to saving resources and reducing waste.

2. Improved Resource Efficiency

The Internet of Things can contribute to more efficient and sustainable resource management in the following areas.

• Intelligent Water Management: IoT devices can aid in optimizing water usage in agriculture. Sensing systems can monitor soil moisture, weather conditions and crop types, enabling precise irrigation. Adopting such technology could result in noticeable water savings.

• Yield Monitoring And Crop Management: With the ability to watch crop health and soil conditions, IoT solutions can help farmers make informed decisions about harvesting and planting, leading to better crop management and reduction of resource waste.

• Energy Conservation: IoT devices can monitor and optimize energy usage in agricultural processing and storage facilities, reducing operational costs and improving overall sustainability.

• Predictive Analytics For Improved Resource Planning: Adopting IoT systems can be beneficial for data analysis to predict future resource needs, helping farmers plan more efficiently.

3. Environmental Monitoring

Using a network of interconnected devices like sensors and drones enables real-time monitoring of various conditions. When combined with cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), these technologies allow for advanced data processing and predictive analytics in crop yields, disease detection and the automation of farming processes, thereby optimizing resource use and adapting to climate change.

The layers of IoT networks can collect data on environmental variables like humidity, light and temperature to ensure informed decisions regarding practical resource and crop management. Monitoring environmental parameters like air quality, soil health and water usage helps promote more sustainable farming practices.

4. Supporting Livestock Management

As mentioned above, IoT systems can help oversee real-time environmental conditions affecting livestock, like air quality, ventilation, climate and lighting. It allows farmers to respond to abnormalities and improve animal welfare quickly. These technologies also enable location tracking and create virtual boundaries, aiding in livestock monitoring and theft prevention by setting up alerts in case animals stray beyond designated areas.

Additionally, IoT technology can help maintain the health of livestock. IoT devices' continuous monitoring of vital signs, including heart rate and respiration, allows for early detection of illnesses and prompt interventions.

Adopting IoT systems can aid in optimizing feeding processes. It enables the building of convenient setups for automated feeding that distribute precise feed quantities, ensuring proper nutrition and reducing potential feed waste. These systems can also help monitor water levels in tanks and troughs and automate refilling intervals for a consistent water supply.

5. Smart Irrigation Systems

IoT-enabled irrigation systems can adjust the amount of water based on the moisture level of the soil and weather predictions. It conserves water and ensures crops receive the optimal amount for growth. Such smart irrigation systems can comprise different kinds of sensors, including:

• Soil sensors collect data on moisture, salinity, electrical conductivity and other vital parameters that help understand soil's condition and anticipate irrigation needs.

• Weather sensors (or evapotranspiration sensors) that measure local environmental conditions, like water evaporation from the soil and plant transpiration, are crucial for accurate water predictions.

• Plant sensors attached to plants aid in monitoring changes such as swelling or shrinking, indicating water content and health status.

Intelligent irrigation systems use these sensors to send real-time data to a central system, automatically controlling water pumps based on the detected moisture or temperature levels. Farmers can manage these systems via cloud-based platforms or mobile applications, allowing for real-time adjustments and overseeing.

Irrigation systems can be further enhanced with advanced software incorporating satellite data, weather forecasts and even AI algorithms for more precise water management.

Challenges And Opportunities

The Internet of Things can vastly improve farming practices and contribute to more sustainable agriculture, which is critical in the face of the global climate crisis. Nevertheless, it comes with unique challenges. Due to its high initial costs, it may not be accessible to everyone, especially in developing countries. Moreover, the complexity of such intelligent IoT ecosystems may also be a significant obstacle.

However, overcoming these challenges and adopting IoT in modern agriculture produces invaluable opportunities that enable optimizing processes and saving resources, ultimately benefiting everyone since higher sustainability in farming is essential for the planet's welfare.

I believe it is essential to encourage the adoption of IoT and other deep-tech solutions like AI and machine learning to boost progress.

Plus, have the Dutch found the answer to burnout culture?","Good morning.
Leading Palestinian human rights groups have accused the UN special advisor on the prevention of genocide of 
failing to fulfil her mandate
 after she issued only one statement on the war in Gaza – largely supportive of Israel – that has claimed 26,000 Palestinian lives.
In a statement issued in October, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, a Kenyan, omitted any criticism of Israel.
In a letter sent to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Wednesday, 16 Palestinian groups, including the umbrella body the Palestinian human rights council, said there had been a 'glaring absence of any action in response to the sustained mass atrocities endured by Palestinians in Gaza', and that this raised 'significant concerns about the special advisor's capability to execute her mandate with due effectiveness and impartiality'.
More broadly, the groups accused Nderitu of a dereliction of duty in failing to warn of a potential genocide, and said there had been a deafening failure by her to speak out about what had happened in Gaza.

Black and Hispanic voters are deserting the Democratic party in numbers that will present a concern for Joe Biden's re-election effort, 
a poll has found
.
Among Black Americans expressing a party preference, the Democratic lead over Republicans has dropped by almost 20% in only three years, according to the Gallup survey.
The Democratic lead among Hispanic adults and adults aged 18 to 29, meanwhile, slid by almost the same proportion, leaving the party with only a modest advantage.
Both groups, especially Black voters, were key ingredients of the alliance that gave Biden a more than 7m-vote advantage over Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The loss was only partly offset by modest gains among college-educated Americans, with and without college degrees, Gallup found.
 
What does it mean for Biden's re-election prospects?
 The drop in support of non-Hispanic Black voters will perhaps be most alarming for the Biden re-election campaign. In 2020, the Democratic party held a 77-11 percentage point advantage over Republicans in that demographic, which has sunk to a 66-19 lead.


Judge rejects Trump's mistrial motions in E Jean Carroll defamation case

Donald Trump's motions for a mistrial in the defamation case brought against him by the writer E Jean Carroll have been 
rejected by a federal judge
, who added that the former president's issues with the verdict had no 'merit'.
In an order filed yesterday, Judge Lewis Kaplan said the motion for a mistrial 'made no sense' and that approving it 'would have been entirely pointless'. Trump's lawyers had previously called for a mistrial in the middle of their cross-examination of Carroll, which the judge denied at the time, instructing the jury to disregard the counsel's remarks. He reiterated his decision and sharply criticized the efforts of Trump's attorney in the written order this week.
Last month, Trump was ordered to pay Carroll an additional $83.3m after Kaplan found that he had defamed her in 2019. A jury previously had found that Trump had sexually abused her, awarding her $5m. Shortly after the judge's decision, Trump decried it on Truth Social as 'absolutely ridiculous' and said he would be filing an appeal.
 
On what grounds did Trump try and get a mistrial?
 Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, requested the mistrial after Carroll discussed deleting some death threats she had received to help with her anxiety and 'get control of the situation'. Habba accused Carroll of 'deleting evidence' and made the unusual mistrial request in front of the jury.

, the tiny air pollution particles emitted by sources as varied as power plants, factories, car exhaust and wildfires. Also known as fine particle pollution, soot is one of the nation's most widespread air pollutants. It is also one of the most dangerous, causing an estimated 85,000 to 200,000 excess US deaths annually; the tiny particles can become lodged in human lungs and sometimes even enter the bloodstream.
The strengthened pollution controls, unveiled yesterday, will lower the annual soot standard to 9 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down from the previous standard of 12 micrograms.

In the 19th century, the German zoologist Christian Bergmann pondered a simple question: why are some animals so small? His answer, that a warm-blooded animal's size increases as its habitat cools, remains a rule in biology to this day. With much of life on Earth still unknown, scientists are discovering new tiny organisms every year, redefining what is considered the smallest of their kind but these tiny creatures can sometimes struggle to get the same conservation attention as their larger, charismatic counterparts. Patrick Greenfield asked scientists to 
tell us about the smallest creatures of their kind

AI And The Economy: Manufacturing's Benefits Are Mostly Outside The Factory,Bill Conerly,2024-02-08 12:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/02/08/ai-and-the-economy-manufacturings-benefits-are-mostly-outside-the-factory/,forbes.com,"Artificial intelligence will help manufacturing by better understanding of demand for products and supply of inputs, with lesser impacts on what happens inside the plant.","Artificial intelligence will help manufacturing by better understanding of demand for products and supply of inputs, with lesser impacts on what happens inside the plant. Robot technology continues to improve, but not at the rapid pace of the large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots such as ChatGPT.

The LLMs have made huge advances in processing words, numbers and images. Although many people hear 'artificial intelligence' and think 'robots,' don't expect the LLMs to power robots any time soon. The LLMs gained power when huge quantities of data, scraped from the Internet, were used to train the models. Comparable data have not been assembled for robots, yet. Robotics will continue to improve thanks to better sensors, chips and experience, but not immediately at the rapid pace of LLMs.

Manufacturing's benefits from AI will come mostly from better understanding of product demand and materials supply. Both will benefit from the integration of large language models with statistical models. Businesses have used statistics for many years, but the data had to be formatted precisely, and the data analyst had to know the various types of predictive models and how to use each one. Then the analyst either guessed at the appropriate model to use or spent many hours trying different models to determine which worked the best.

One model of predictive analytics systems combine large language models with statistical analysis software. The LLMs take instructions in English, such as, 'Help me predict how many of my Widget-1000 will be ordered next July.' The system then connects the LLM to the company's database of past orders. The LLM can format the data as needed. Either a statistical model can be developed or machine learning applied directly to the data. Finally, the system can tell the plant manager—in English or any language—how many orders to expect, along with a 95% confidence interval.

On the supply side, a similar process can predict late deliveries of input materials as well as workers sick or on vacation.

The predictions won't be perfect, but they will be better than the common 'finger in the wind' approach.

Engineers will find that AI can help with product design. The research firm AIMultiple explains, 'Designers or engineers enter parameters of design (such as materials, size, weight, strength, manufacturing methods, and cost constraints) into generative design software and the software provides all the possible outcomes that can be created with those parameters. With this method, manufacturers quickly generate thousands of design options for one product.'

On the factory floor, two AI advances are improving activity. Machine learning (a building block of AI) can help predict needed maintenance. In addition to recommended maintenance schedules from a machine's manufacturer, the system can monitor performance, both in quantity and quality of production. It can correlate this data with historical downtime records to anticipate upcoming problems. This will be easier where a factory has many machines of the same type.

The other factory-floor improvement automates quality inspections. Some inspections are simple and can be performed with old technology, but some inspections today require judgment from humans. For those products, sensors will inspect the item. The inspection could examine an image for size and flaws, weight and sound. They system would be trained at the same time humans are inspecting the process. The system would try to match the human's judgement. Eventually, the system will be as good as the human. Afterwards, some human inspection would probably verify that the AI is working correctly.

AI will help manufacturing but not revolutionize it. That matches my general conclusion that the domain of physical objects will be less impacted by AI.

I lost my baby – and apologised to the midwife for taking up her time. Here's why,ter,2024-02-08 12:20:51,full,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/08/i-lost-my-baby-and-apologised-to-the-midwife-for-taking-up-her-time-heres-why,theguardian.com,"I was making a documentary about the UK's midwife crisis when I miscarried. By then I had heard time and again about understaffing, depression, burnout …","T
he image of the midwives entering my home is as vivid today as it was nearly four years ago at the height of Covid. I remember the sound of their voices. Bright and breezy. Calm and confident. They must have been masking any fear they had following my phone call pleading for them to come straight away. I couldn't move. I was 19 hours into my labour and refusing to go to the hospital. I had almost given up. I'd remained on all fours on the bed all that time and the pain was too great to make the drive to the birth centre. I was scared and my body had stopped doing whatever it was that it was doing.
'Thank God,' I thought, when I heard them. 'They've arrived.' The sense of relief that I felt was immense. I took one look at them and I knew I'd be OK. Within the next hours, my son was finally born. So grateful was I for the midwives and their support, I attempted to go to the kitchen and bring them tea and cake. The umbilical cord was still attached and I'd not yet delivered my placenta.
'You're not going anywhere,' one replied, laughing. Clearly my oxytocin levels were through the roof.
At our most vulnerable moment, we depend on midwives to keep us safe and brave
I'm not sure anyone forgets their midwives. At what can often be a woman's most vulnerable and scariest moment, we depend on them to keep us safe, comforted and brave.
Yet too many women are rushed through our maternity wards on what some midwives refer to as a conveyor belt. I had given birth unexpectedly at home and, on the whole, I'd describe the experience as eye-opening. Empowering, even. But afterwards I discovered that colleagues and friends who had given birth in hospital had had traumatising experiences with limited aftercare. They had not felt listened to or attended to. They'd felt abandoned, stressed, coerced and rushed. They'd lost blood, got infections, become delusional. There was not one positive birth story among them. I started to look into it, and found that about 
30,000 women a year develop post-traumatic stress disorder following birth
. Increasingly, I wanted to know what was happening behind those hospital walls.
About a year after the birth of my son, when I began to feel a little less sleep-deprived, I began to make contact with midwives to find out more. Many were gearing up for a campaign called 
March With Midwives
 – organised to raise awareness about the impact that work conditions were having on them and the women using the services. The Royal College of Midwives had already announced 
a shortage in England of 2,500 midwives
. A staffing and safety crisis, midwives told me, was making maternity services unsustainable, so I decided to make a documentary on the subject, using their stories.

By that point, three maternity reviews into individual trusts had taken place. After each one, midwives said they felt blamed and as if they couldn't defend themselves. They were too scared to speak out for fear of either losing their jobs or scaring women away from coming to hospital to give birth. Essentially they felt that they had no voice. But now, some were beginning to feel as if enough was enough and, bravely, they agreed to speak with me over Zoom.
'I don't want women and babies to be at risk any more,' said Sharon at Gloucestershire 
Hospitals
 NHS Foundation trust, who had been a midwife for nearly 30 years. 'What we deemed as safe when we first opened the ward was a minimum of eight staff on a day shift. Now you could end up with four.' An anonymous whistleblower at the trust also told me that some nights there could be just two midwives working instead of six.
One night I got a phone call from a distressed midwife. She told me about junior midwives being left to work alone on triage; sick midwives given Lemsip and Tic Tacs rather than being sent home, and long delays for women who had been induced. Inductions are often recommended if a baby is overdue or if there's a risk to mother or baby's health; they occur in almost a third of all births. 'But when it comes to their induction day, they are being delayed again and again because we have half the staff we need,' the midwife explained. When the induction is delayed, the labour often does not continue, and so the level of risk increases. 'One day, we will find that a baby has died because we couldn't do things in a timely manner.'
And a year into my research, this happened at Gloucestershire Royal hospital. A woman who had been induced for medical reasons ended up waiting five days to be taken down to the delivery suite where she could give birth with the recommended one-to-one care. Essentially her labour had been put on pause as she waited for a midwife to become free
 
and, on the fifth day, the baby's heartbeat could no longer be found.
The trust summary of an independent investigation into the death confirmed that 'staffing levels impacted the mother's induction of labour and sufficient staffing may have changed the outcome for the baby'. The Gloucestershire Hospitals trust said it had introduced a quality-improvement project focused on induction, and that it was determined to learn and change when things go wrong.
But problems with inductions are not limited to the Gloucestershire trust. Midwives from two other UK trusts told me of similar incidents, and 
the Care and Quality Commission has highlighted the issue in a number of other trusts
. We submitted an FOI to the NHS's investigative branch, the Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations Programme (MNSI, formally HSIB), and found that in the past three and a half years, it has looked into more than 200 cases where induction of labour has been one of the causes that led to either injury or death.
James Walker, professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Leeds, says: 'One of the problems is that the number of inductions has increased –
 
partly because the methods of induction are easier [and partly due to] a change in policy about how long a pregnancy should go on for and what is dangerous – without anyone really sitting down to work out how best to manage this, to make sure you've got the right number of staff, the right facilities to do it in the ever-important timescale.' It is also questionable whether such high numbers of inductions are in fact necessary.
What is it like for a midwife to worry that an avoidable death will happen on their watch?
I cannot imagine what it must be like for a midwife to go to work wanting to bring healthy babies into the world and instead end up worrying if an avoidable baby death will happen on their watch. In the Panorama documentary I made about this issue, we hear from midwives who are told not to bother escalating issues of staffing by management. 'You're almost greeted with: ‘Well, we know the staffing is bad. What's the point in putting in another complaint about it?''
This culture of not being listened to is something Dr Bill Kirkup, who led major maternity reviews in Morecambe Bay and east Kent, says is present in every inquiry: 'There's a massive common ground to all of these reports. If you do a kind of word cloud of the things that you read, then the same terms do come up. And they do involve things like culture and compassion and listening.'
A Facebook group called 
Beyond Midwifery
 has more than 4,000 members – all of whom have either left the profession or are desperate to leave it. They post about being off work due to anxiety and depression. One midwife says the impact on her 'mental health is too much'. Another says she has 'suicidal thoughts, sitting at train stations late at night thinking about how to get out of work'. In my research, midwives have also told me about how they had turned to self-harming to cope.
In Gloucestershire, an anonymous whistleblower said her biggest fear is that it would take the death of a midwife for things to change. 'That's not even necessarily women and babies dying,' she said. 'Is it going to have to get to the point where a midwife takes her own life because of how she feels about work, because of the pressure that she's under?' The Gloucestershire trust says that, in the past three years, it has increased midwifery posts from 243 to 264 and strengthened the ways in which staff can 'speak up safely'.
An expert in early pregnancy sonography gave me the news: ‘I'm afraid your baby is not compatible with life'
I became pregnant while I was making the documentary last autumn, but lost the baby at three months. It meant I found myself going through the system I was investigating. During a routine scan, an expert in early pregnancy sonography gave me the news: 'I'm afraid your baby is not compatible with life.'
I felt shocked and heartbroken at the same time. My work on the documentary meant I was all too aware of what was likely going on behind the scenes. I was experiencing a constant adrenaline rush and found it difficult to take it all in. I turned once again to the midwife present to help me navigate the process physically and emotionally – and, through tears, found myself apologising to her for clogging up the system. 'I'm sorry I'm taking up so much of your time,' I told her. 'I know how busy you are and what you're dealing with.'
The Maternal Fetal Assessment Unit, where I ended up, does, by nature, have a different pace to delivery or antenatal wards. The midwives there are dealing with miscarriages and pregnancy concerns, not babies on the way. But I was grateful for her calm demeanour and comforting manner, despite her workload. 'Don't be silly,' she replied, before leaving to continue training up the newly qualified midwife who was shadowing her.
Midwives tend to put on a brave face. They will always want to be the strength when we don't have it in us. But they are desperate for help – and we need to start listening.

Iran-backed hackers interrupt UAE TV streaming services with deepfake news,Dan Milmo,2024-02-08 12:17:37,full,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/08/iran-backed-hackers-interrupt-uae-tv-streaming-services-with-deepfake-news,theguardian.com,Microsoft analysts cite reports saying disruption by group known as Cotton Sandstorm also reached audiences in UK and Canada,"Iranian state-backed hackers interrupted TV streaming services in the 
United Arab Emirates
 to broadcast a deepfake newsreader delivering a report on the war in Gaza, according to analysts at Microsoft.
The tech company said a hacking operation run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, a key branch of the Iranian armed forces, had disrupted streaming platforms in the UAE with an AI-generated news broadcast branded 'For Humanity'.
The fake news anchor introduced unverified images that claimed to show Palestinians injured and killed from Israeli military operations in Gaza. Analysts at Microsoft said the hacking group, known as Cotton Sandstorm, published videos on the Telegram messaging platform showing it hacking into three online streaming services and disrupting news channels with the fake newscaster.
According to the 
Khaleej Times
, a UAE-based news service, Dubai residents using a HK1RBOXX set-top box were interrupted in December with a message stating: 'We have no choice but to hack to deliver this message to you,' followed by the AI-generated anchor introducing 'graphic' footage, as well as a ticker showing the number of people killed and wounded in Gaza so far.
Microsoft also cited reports of disruptions in Canada and the UK, with the channels affected including the BBC, although the BBC was not hacked directly.
'This marked the first Iranian influence operation Microsoft has detected where AI played a key component in its messaging and is one example of the fast and significant expansion in the scope of Iranian operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict,' Microsoft 
said in a blogpost
 accompanying a report on Iranian cyber-espionage. 'The disruption reached audiences in the UAE, UK, and Canada.'
Breakthroughs in generative AI – the term for technology that can swiftly produce convincing text, voice and image from simple hand-typed prompts – have triggered a rise in deepfake content online, from 
explicit false images of Taylor Swift
 to 
robocalls featuring Joe Biden's AI-generated voice
.
Experts fear AI-made material could be deployed at scale to disrupt elections this year including the US presidential election. Iran targeted the 2020 US election with a cyber-campaign that included sending intimidating emails to voters purporting to be from members of the far-right Proud Boys group, setting up a website inciting violence against the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and others and spreading disinformation about voting infrastructure.
'As we look forward to the 2024 US presidential election, Iranian activities could build on what happened in 2020 when they impersonated American extremists and incited violence against US government officials,' said Microsoft.
Microsoft said Iranian state-backed actors have launched a series of cyber-attacks and online attempts to manipulate opinion since the 7 October Hamas attacks.

Starmer to scale back home insulation scheme as part of green policy U-turn,Kiran Stacey,2024-02-08 12:15:33,full,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/starmer-to-scale-back-home-insulation-scheme-as-part-of-green-policy-u-turn,theguardian.com,Exclusive: Labour insiders say scheme singled out for attack by Tories this week will be major victim of U-turn over £28bn plans,"Keir Starmer is cutting back his ambitious home insulation scheme as part of his decision to scale down Labour's green policy, sources have told the Guardian.

The Labour leader will announce on Thursday that he is drastically reducing the scale of the £28bn 'green prosperity plan' after weeks of uncertainty over the fate of the plan.

People briefed on the scaled-back plan say the party's home insulation scheme, which was singled out for attack by the Conservatives earlier this week, would be the major victim of the cuts.

One person added they expected Labour to promise an additional £5bn a year of additional green spending on top of what the government has already committed, allowing the party to stick to its separate pledge to cut government debt levels.

Starmer is expected to formally announce the U-turn later on Thursday after heavy speculation about whether the £28bn could survive in its original form.

Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, first announced it at the Labour party conference in 2021, as she promised to be the UK's 'first green chancellor'.

Since then, however, Reeves has become much more sceptical about the policy, with economic analysis showing that sticking to the £28bn would violate Labour's separate promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of a five-year period.

Starmer has been lobbied heavily in recent weeks both by supporters of the plan, who say it forms the main plank of Labour's economic policy, and opponents, who worry it could be used against the party in a general election campaign. The Conservatives have claimed that Labour is preparing to put up taxes to help pay for the scheme, though Reeves has denied this.

The home insulation scheme is the largest single item in the green plan, with Labour having promised to spend up to £6bn a year to insulate 19m homes over a decade. A government analysis commissioned by the Conservatives earlier this week suggested the plan could actually cost double that, though Labour said it would fund the scheme through private sector incentives as well as public spending.

Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, said on Thursday morning that Starmer's decision showed his lack of consistency. 'This is a serious moment,' he said. 'This was the flagship plank of Labour's economic policy and it now looks like he's trying to wriggle out of it.'

Sunak added: 'I think it demonstrates exactly what I've been saying, that he U-turns on major things, he can't say what he would do differently because he doesn't have a plan. And if you don't have a plan, then you can't deliver change for our country.'

Starmer was also under fire on Thursday morning from both environmentalists and the left of his party. Barry Gardiner, the former shadow energy secretary, told the BBC: 'Politically, it's strategically incompetent.'

Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: 'If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required. Switching to heat pumps will leave us less dependent on foreign gas imports, running our home heating instead on electricity from British renewables.

'There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Kiran Stacey,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf693404e2d1fc1008d6bab765d0306d10136072/0_0_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5cfaa2bae0f3a70ff3aef152439c1ad2,False,@guardian,,09264488377d429a14df431359e534a1,"['home insulation scheme', ""Labour's green policy"", '£28bn', 'scaled-back plan', 'green spending']","Keir Starmer is cutting back Labour's £28bn 'green prosperity plan', with the home insulation scheme being the major victim of the cuts.

Insights To Navigate The Complexity Of Scope 3 Emissions Reporting,Simi Thambi​,2024-02-08 12:15:05,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simithambi/2024/02/08/insights-to-navigate-the-complexity-of-scope-3-emissions-reporting/,forbes.com,Findings from recent Scope 3 reporting analyses to assist businesses in navigating its complexities.,"The global landscape is moving towards more transparent climate disclosures. Businesses are expanding their reporting to cover emissions from direct operations and their entire value chain, including suppliers. For reporting purposes, emissions are classified into three types: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. Reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased electricity) is straightforward, but Scope 3—indirect emissions from the entire value chain—is more complex. Scope 3's reporting challenge stems from data scarcity, poor data quality, and numerous calculation assumptions. However, reporting on these emissions are essential as they constitute over 70% of a company's total emissions. Therefore, despite its novelty and complexity, navigating this landscape has become crucial to address climate change.

The International Sustainability Standards Board in June last year, mandated the necessity of Scope 3 disclosures, marking a significant step forward. Similar regulations are anticipated in Australia, Japan, California, the UK, and the EU within the next 2-3 years, potentially requiring companies to report on these Scope 3 emissions. Amid these potential regulatory changes, some analyses, including a study published last week and others from the past few months, provide useful insights for navigating this complex terrain.

Reporting On The Most Material Emission Sources

An analysis of 4,000 large and medium companies, released last week, reveals that while many companies report on various Scope 3 emission categories, they often overlook the most material emissions—those with the largest share of total emissions. Over half of the 2,000 companies reporting on Scope 3 emissions omit these crucial categories from their disclosures. This indicates a trend where companies, for reporting purposes, prioritize emissions data that is easier to obtain, potentially overlooking data that, although more challenging to gather, could lead to opportunities for more significant greenhouse gas reductions.

Further, the analysis shows that just two categories—use of sold products and purchased goods and services, among the 17 subcategories of Scope 3 —represent over 80% of these emissions, highlighting their importance for reporting. The subcategories of Scope 3 emissions include diverse activities, from business travel and employee commuting to the purchase of goods and use of sold products. The difficulty of collecting data varies significantly; data on business travel and commuting are more accessible, whereas collecting data on emissions from suppliers, including in the purchased goods category, is more challenging.

What can be done about this? Of course, companies themselves can proactively ensure the most material categories are calculated and conveyed. Investors can play a role, too. When they engage with companies, it will be beneficial to encourage them to report their most significant categories. With the growing interest among investors in using Scope 3 data more meaningfully— to understand nuances of carbon exposure in their portfolio, rather than merely aggregating data across categories —such engagement with companies will further advance the climate strategies of investors.

Supporting Suppliers In Reducing Their Emissions

Even when companies report on Scope 3 emissions, their actions to address these emissions are often limited. According to an analysis by the Carbon Disclosure Project—a global database—only about a third of the approximately 7,300 companies surveyed engage with their suppliers.

Gathering data from suppliers presents challenges, mainly due to supply chains' global and diverse nature. The burden of collecting and reporting data is especially cumbersome for companies in emerging market economies or those that are small in size. These companies often need more monetary or human resources as well as the required skills to undertake such reporting. Last year, the Federal Chamber of Commerce emphasized the disproportionate burden that additional greenhouse gas reporting could impose on small businesses in a letter to the government.

Supporting suppliers, small and medium-sized enterprises, necessitates support from large corporations, often the most crucial clients of these enterprises. Industry collaborations, including the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders group and Transform to Net Zero—which encompasses multinationals—strive to foster climate action across global supply chains. There is also helpful guidance from standard-setting bodies, such as the Science-Based Targets Initiative, from selecting suitable suppliers and securing internal buy-in to reporting on target progress.

What More Can Be Done? In the future, continuing to showcase supplier engagement in practice might be beneficial. A notable example is the best practice report by UN Global Compact Denmark, which highlights practical supplier engagement strategies, from offering financing incentives for farmers to implementing carbon intensity screening tools. Similarly, the SME Climate Hub showcases the best practices of enterprises from Latin America, India, and the US. Highlighting these best practices in regional languages could also help.

Without doubt, the complexity of reporting and setting targets for Scope 3 emissions is unprecedented. However, the effort is worthwhile as it enhances the visibility of the most significant source of emissions. To effectively navigate this challenge, it's crucial for all parties involved in reporting and utilizing these disclosures to continue sharing their experiences on public platforms and with standard setters and regulators, fostering collaborative learning.

Justin Soong Forbes Councils Member,Justin Soong,2024-02-08 12:15:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/generative-ai-and-the-risk-around-digital-trust/,forbes.com,"As we integrate these advancements into the fabric of our digital lives, a crucial question emerges: What is the impact of generative AI on digital trust?","Generative AI has democratized content creation, enabling individuals and businesses to generate high-quality digital assets quickly and efficiently. Its applications span various sectors, from creating art and writing to assisting in scientific research and educational tools. This versatility not only enhances productivity but also inspires creativity and innovation.

This technology, in essence, embodies the immense benefits that AI can offer. However, as we integrate these advancements into the fabric of our digital lives, a crucial question emerges: What is the impact of generative AI on digital trust?

The Digital Trust Dilemma

Despite the benefits, generative AI introduces significant risks. For example, the ease with which this technology can create convincing fake content—be it images, videos or audio—opens the door to potential misuse. The ability to impersonate individuals, fabricate scenarios or alter historical records poses a profound ethical and security challenge.

For example, deepfakes—hyper-realistic fake videos or audio—could be used to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion or even incite violence. The risk isn't just theoretical—there have already been instances of deepfakes used to create false narratives or impersonate public figures. Similarly, AI-generated text can create authentic-looking fake news, blurring the lines between fact and fiction.

Real-World Consequences

The implications of this technology in the wrong hands are vast. We could see an increase in scams and fraud as AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from genuine articles. Imagine a scenario in which a deepfake video ignites geopolitical tensions, leading to real-world conflicts. The erosion of trust in digital content could have far-reaching consequences, impacting everything from journalism to justice.

Every interaction and every piece of content is now at risk. Can you trust that next email, tweet, invoice to pay or phone call?

Emerging Solutions And Hope

However, the future isn't bleak. Emerging technologies are being developed to counter these risks and reinforce digital trust.

For solutions to work, digital trust has to be established at the transaction and interaction level. Verifying people and entities just once and trusting them forever doesn't hold in the world of generative AI. Imagine a world where everything has a digital checkmark, assuring you that any given interaction has been authorized and created by the assumed party.

The great news is that there are models that can be applied to all our digital interactions, contributing to a greater level of trust and assurance in our daily lives. One such model is zero trust, a security approach widely employed by organizations to manage access to systems within a corporate environment.

Zero trust emphasizes the following principles.

Verify explicitly. Every interaction needs to be verified, regardless of previous successful attempts.

Provide least-privilege access. Only allow the most limited set of data points or privileges that meet the requirements for a given interaction.

Assume a breach. This principle takes a security posture that assumes that there's already been a breach or that there will be, ""so it constantly limits access to only what is needed and looks for anomalous or malicious activity."" However, to contextualize it within the emerging threat of generative AI, we need to remember that it's not just about limiting access but rather about verifying users using methods that aren't as susceptible to breaches.

Solutions that can satisfy the principles of zero trust can drive us toward a more secure and trustworthy digital world, mitigating the risks introduced by generative AI. Three notable innovations in this regard are passkeys, decentralized identity technologies and blockchain/Web3.

1. Passkeys: Utilizing asymmetric cryptography, passkeys offer a robust method for secure transactions and digital interactions. They provide a higher level of security and trust compared to traditional passwords, reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized access. Passkeys also help provide a seamless user experience through the use of biometrics.

2. Decentralized Identity Technologies: These include verifiable credentials and standards like mDL (mobile driver's license). They empower users to control their digital identity, ensuring that personal information is shared securely and only with consent. This approach not only enhances privacy but also fortifies trust in digital interactions.

3. Blockchain/Web3: We've seen the last Web3 innovation wave prove that the mass adoption of blockchain technology is viable and that its fundamental principles offer both security and trust. Watch Web3 technologies start to become more mainstream as the technical idiosyncrasies lessen over time.

Looking Forward

As we stand at this crossroads, it's imperative to balance innovation in AI with mechanisms that ensure digital trust. Technologies like passkeys, decentralized identity systems and blockchain offer a beacon of hope. They represent the potential to mitigate risks, safeguard against misuse and maintain the integrity of our digital world.

Although the challenges posed by generative AI are significant, they aren't insurmountable. By focusing on developing and adopting technologies that enhance digital trust, we can harness the full potential of AI while safeguarding our digital future.

Hardware And Software Infrastructure Supply Chain Under Fire: The Current Challenges,Yuriy Bulygin,2024-02-07 11:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/07/hardware-and-software-infrastructure-supply-chain-under-fire-the-current-challenges/,forbes.com,There are no easy ways to root out potential vulnerabilities that exist deep within the digital supply chain.,"Yuriy Bulygin is CEO and co-founder of Eclypsium.

Today's modern global economy, much like the internet itself, operates like an intricate web where everything has grown increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Just as the strongest web can be undone by pulling a single thread, so too can the supply chain of digital infrastructure.

In the domain of cybersecurity, we are dealing with our own supply chain uncertainties that are subject to many of the same macroeconomic entanglements, and their impact extends far beyond matters of trade and commerce and into the realm of national security.

At the center is a complex supply chain of software code and hardware-based components that a sprawling ecosystem of global suppliers develops and maintains—from networking equipment, security appliances and IoT devices to applications, virtual machines and the open-source software that powers every device and piece of equipment in a network's infrastructure.

In the race to manufacture equipment at the lowest possible cost, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) providers will acquire and integrate components from dozens—if not hundreds—of third-party technology vendors. Increasingly, threat actors have recognized that this complexity represents an opportunity to weaponize it for their own nefarious purposes.

Take the September 2023 CISA advisory on BlackTech, the state-backed group linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC) that's been able to successfully compromise public-facing routers—enabling it to open backdoors and establish persistence in its victims' networks. There was also the hack involving SolarWinds in late 2020 in which a vulnerable software update affected thousands of enterprise customers.

Because the preinstalled software that hardware manufacturers and component suppliers use plays such a critical role in every device in the infrastructure, it also makes it a most attractive target for today's threat actors. Since it's buried so deep across the technology stack, many IT security leaders have been lulled into complacency—blissfully unaware of the danger that lurks beneath.

It's also why many threat actors have devoted more resources to exploiting these vulnerabilities. The Volt Typhoon campaign, which has been attributed to the PRC, is just the latest example of a state-sponsored attack that targets underlying supply chain components to maintain stealth and escalate network privileges.

According to the Microsoft post detailing the threat, the Volt Typhoon campaign ""is pursuing development of capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises [and] has been active since mid-2021."" In other words, one of our top adversaries may have been digging around some of our nation's most sensitive military secrets.

What's hiding in your digital supply chain?

It's been more than a decade now since Marc Andreessen proclaimed that ""software is eating the world."" By this, he meant that every business, regardless of its industry, must embrace a software-first approach or risk being outpaced by competitors that do. Indeed, his prediction has come to pass, as software is now ubiquitous—from the apps we use on our phones and the software that runs our vehicles to the embedded software that powers every piece of infrastructure hardware in the modern IT stack.

Consider the laptop that you might be using at this very moment. Whether it's a MacBook Pro, a Dell or a Lenovo, each one of these manufacturers relies upon dozens of direct suppliers who, in turn, source their components from hundreds of subordinate suppliers from across the globe. Even if you explicitly trust a particular vendor, how confident can you be that all of its suppliers are adhering to industry-accepted security best practices?

Unfortunately, there are no easy ways to root out potential vulnerabilities that exist deep within the digital supply chain. Whereas network scanning tools are designed to scan known, accessible systems, they weren't designed to penetrate the depths of a multitier supply chain to evaluate the security postures of all entities involved.

Because modern supply chains are highly dynamic with new suppliers being added and subtracted according to economic pressures or regulatory requirements, maintaining a consistent and comprehensive overview of all of these parties can overwhelm even the largest, most sophisticated enterprise organization.

This challenge was exemplified in the CISA advisory on the LockBit ransomware, which has quickly grown to become one of the most pervasive threats. It accounted for 16% of government ransomware incidents in 2022 and notably has increasingly set its sights on the vendor supply chain ecosystem. In 2023, a zero-day vulnerability dubbed Citrix Bleed was discovered that allowed LockBit to hijack authenticated sessions and compromise numerous organizations, including Boeing and Toyota Financial Services.

The challenge of securing the digital supply chain is further complicated by the fact that software is embedded far and wide across the hardware ecosystem—from the endpoint devices to the thousands of network peripherals that route traffic and authenticate users, and now to the billions of connected IoT devices that power the global supply chain.

Further obscuring the issue is the fact that few hardware vendors write their own software, instead relying on their supply chain partners who typically license it from a third party or integrate a variety of open-source software into their own end product.

2023 saw a number of high-profile ransomware attacks on major supply chain vendors. A ransomware attack crippled a partner of semiconductor giant Applied Materials, disrupting shipments and causing it to miss an estimated $250 million in sales. Technology conglomerate Cisco suffered a ransomware campaign that exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities to create admin accounts and install implants on Cisco IOS XE devices, compromising over 40,000 devices.

In a future article, I plan on looking at the steps security leaders should take to improve resiliency and ensure the integrity of their downstream supply chains.

These systems serve as important tools to unify different parts of a business, facilitate processes for sharing information, provide insights for decision making and improve the general efficiency of operations. ERP and SCM help companies better manage their resources and respond to changing market demands by offering a unified view of business processes.

In the first part of this series, I discussed trends and challenges affecting ERP, along with some of the key ERP vendors. Now I'm moving on to SCM. In this article, I will look closely at SCM solutions, breaking down the complexities and innovations in this area of the market, and provide my insights on expected trends and developments.

SCM Leans On AI

AI-enabled low-touch planning is gaining prominence in SCM, helping to bridge the gap between supply chain planning and execution. This approach leverages AI to reduce the need for human intervention in supply chain operations, leading to increased efficiency, accuracy and agility in the supply chain. There's a growing trend toward leveraging technology to improve transparency and visibility in collaboration. At the same time, there is a strong emphasis on achieving sustainability, meeting regulatory standards and reducing risks.

As you can imagine, many factors can disrupt a supply chain, and if you think about everything that can influence the movement of goods and services, you can feel the pain that businesses must routinely overcome. According to survey data, the leading challenge is mergers and acquisitions, responsible for 66% of disruptions, followed by extreme weather at 41%, factory fires at 37% and business sales at 33%. Yet even with these challenges, companies are not adequately harnessing SCM capabilities to lessen the impact of disruptions. For instance, proactive supply chain management, which allows companies to anticipate and address supply or demand shifts before they become critical, is practiced by only 22% of companies.

Just as with ERP, SCM is moving forward by incorporating innovative technologies. Here are some of the trends set to shape the industry this year.

Embedded AI — Integrating AI and machine learning directly into SCM enables the system to automate various tasks and connect all stages of planning and execution. Demand forecasting, inventory optimization, transportation management, warehouse automation and predictive maintenance are examples of processes that have been optimized by AI and ML to improve efficiency and supply chain resilience.
Visibility and collaboration — Having a clear view of the supply chain is crucial to prevent delays and mistakes. This means you need to be able to share data with internal teams and collaborate effectively to identify trends and resolve issues. One example of this visibility is when an SCM integrates information from RFID devices used to tag containers in a warehouse. The system can monitor the containers and their locations to provide real-time inventory tracking, which allows the business to monitor inventory levels and minimize the risk of stockouts or overstocking. AI tools are also being used to analyze data and improve collaboration in demand forecasting, production planning and inventory management.
Supply and demand matching — Continuing with the data focus, advanced algorithms powered by AI and ML offer optimization to improve the alignment of supply and demand. Imagine a scenario where products can be instantly and dynamically reassigned to orders to reduce costs and enhance service levels. Traditional inventory management relies on forecasts and pre-allocated channels, which can be unreliable. Dynamic reallocation, by contrast, factors in real-time inventory information and order specifics alongside consideration of any external disruption factors to support more effective decision making.
Sustainability — I anticipate a growing focus on environmentally friendly supply chains, where ESG factors become integral to SCM systems. Executed well, this will enhance both financial and environmental performance. This shift will involve companies evaluating both themselves and suppliers to ensure sustainability; this can include monitoring use of recycled materials and renewable energy, maintenance of ethical labor practices and support for using local sources to reduce emissions tied to transportation. Implementing green logistics for tracking carbon footprints throughout a product's lifecycle will also play a significant role. This transition towards sustainability is essential for creating eco-friendly and sustainable supply chain practices, which will be even more important as concerns over climate change and resource scarcity increase.
Resilience — The disruptions of 2023 emphasized the need for flexible and strong supply chains. This has led to a greater focus on reducing risks, planning for different scenarios and diversifying suppliers and sourcing locations. The goals are to avoid dependence on single sources, to prevent bottlenecks and to bring production closer to demand to improve responsiveness and reduce reliance on long-distance transportation. SCM systems enhance the resilience of supply chains, allowing companies to predict, address and recover from disruptions while maintaining efficient operations and the steady flow of goods and services.
Blockchain — Blockchain technology significantly impacts SCM by improving transparency, traceability and security throughout the supply chain. It enables tracing products from raw materials to final delivery, promotes real-time data sharing among stakeholders and ensures tamper-proof records, reducing the risk of fraud and cyber threats. I see much potential in blockchain to revolutionize supply chain operations, enhancing trust and security within the ecosystem.

SCM Implementations And Challenges

Introducing a new SCM system is a complex endeavor, yet it can provide a competitive edge, as indicated by 57% of companies surveyed. Additionally, 70% of companies consider a good SCM to be a critical element for providing quality customer service.

However, as with ERP implementations, SCMs are subject to a laundry list of challenges that can lead to failures. The implementation of a new SCM can face technical hurdles, such as integrating it with existing IT systems, migrating data accurately and customizing the software to fit unique business requirements—all of which can be expensive. From an organizational standpoint, overcoming internal resistance to change and getting employees on board with new processes demand effective communication and training strategies. Financially, the upfront and ongoing costs of a new SCM system, including unexpected expenses, can put pressure on budgets. Additional challenges such as project scope creep, vendor selection and new security vulnerabilities further complicate implementations.

To navigate these challenges, a business needs a well-thought-out approach that includes setting clear objectives, engaging stakeholders throughout the process, selecting a vendor with a strong track record, planning carefully for data migration, training users thoroughly, communicating clearly and setting realistic expectations about time and costs involved.

Navigating Global Supply Chains' Rising Tides,Brian Enright,2024-02-07 12:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/07/navigating-global-supply-chains-rising-tides/,forbes.com,Severe weather events and changing climate patterns are forcing international logistics and trade organizations to confront very real economic and operational challenges.,"Brian Enright is the CEO and Managing Director of DP World Americas.

Let's delve into a different kind of rising tide—one where the natural world converges with the financial. In the realm of global trade and logistics, heightened flood risk can take center stage, revealing the critical overlap between environmental challenges and economic activities.

Severe weather events and changing climate patterns are forcing international logistics and trade organizations to confront very real, multifaceted economic and operational challenges. The rise in sea levels, a primary consequence of the altered climate, has increased by approximately eight to nine inches since 1880. There has been a noticeable acceleration in recent years, with elevated tides and storm surges that are rendering coastlines susceptible to inundation.

It's also imposing significant costs on governments, corporations, NGOs, regional economies and other stakeholders. In 2019, flooding accrued a hefty price tag of $82 billion for global economies, a substantial fraction of weather-related expenses, outpacing wildfire costs by elevenfold, according to the Wall Street Journal. And forecasts anticipate a mounting financial burden, potentially surpassing $1.2 trillion annually, as reported by the Journal.

The World Bank noted $110 billion in losses from natural catastrophes in the first half of 2023, and projections by the University of Melbourne suggest that rising waters could endanger up to 3% of global GDP by the century's close.

As the World Trade Organization stated in its 2022 World Trade Report, it's 'clear that trade and climate change are deeply intertwined.'

Rising Flood Risks Threaten Global Supply Chains

So, what does this mean for global supply chain networks? Efficient end-to-end supply chain logistics play a crucial role in facilitating global trade flow, while technological investments and innovative methodologies offer significant potential in cost reduction and resilience reinforcement.

However, extreme floods pose a serious risk to global supply chains. Recent events expose regional vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for robust flood mitigation strategies.

For example, the Mississippi River floods of 2011 suspended barge traffic and cost $300 million a day in transportation costs for the entire river. Total damages cost anywhere from $3 to $5 billion. That same year, flooding in Thailand shut down global car and electronics factories, disrupting supply chains and costing more than $30 billion.

In July 2021, British Columbia, Canada, witnessed widespread flooding due to intense rainfall measuring up to 252 millimeters (nearly 10 inches) in 48 hours, causing breached dikes, submerged roads and significantly impacting crops and homes across a broad area.

According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), major floods doubled over the past two decades, resulting in annual costs averaging about $3 trillion. It will be critical for supply chain stakeholders to identify the components of resilient supply chain networks that are less vulnerable to flood risks.

The Urgent Need For Resilient Strategies

Adopting flood-proofing and prevention strategies becomes imperative for mitigating expenses and ensuring operational continuity amidst climate-induced obstacles. The current and future challenges demand adaptability, separating organizations that prepare for what lies ahead from those that might stagnate.

Mitigation strategies significantly reduce loss of life and property, confirming the crucial role preparedness plays. Companies that invest in proactive risk reduction can experience notably less significant losses during similar disaster events. This proactive approach shapes processes, fosters an adaptable organizational mindset and establishes clear accountability, protocols and decisive chains of command.

For my company, we show our dedication to risk management and environmental stewardship through active involvement in the First Mover Coalition. This collaborative initiative is geared toward pioneering critical climate technologies across diverse sectors, placing a special emphasis on shipping.

Active preparation through infrastructure investments, technological adoption, recruitment and embracing inevitable changes will position some as part of the solution, whereas those resisting change—or riding the status quo—may falter. Addressing these challenges requires proactive intervention, leaning into strengths while openly acknowledging shortcomings.

Fortifying Supply Chains

The fusion of robust supply chain logistics and cutting-edge technology forms a potent defense against escalating threats. By investing in tech and methodologies, leaders can unlock substantial opportunities for cost-cutting and bolstering resilience against supply chain disruptions.

And as we grapple with this mounting threat, foresight becomes crucial. It emphasizes the need to adopt a comprehensive set of strategies to combat flooding and prevent adverse effects.

For example, evolved cargo storage and racking systems for ports and logistics facilities can play an important role in flood mitigation, providing vital protection by physically elevating valuable containers to secure heights beyond the reach of damaging waters and ensuring operational adaptability amidst tide surges and adverse weather conditions.

Additionally, sophisticated surveillance and predictive analytics tools offer real-time weather tracking, facilitating early identification and reaction to potential flood scenarios. Intelligent infrastructure featuring sensor-laden flood barriers and adaptive logistics planning algorithms can provide an additional layer of preemptive protection.

Moreover, the incorporation of energy solutions like solar-powered logistics centers, battery storage and environmentally responsible transportation investments underscores a wider pledge to ecological resilience.

Technology-driven solutions can not only enhance efficiency but also serve as a proactive safeguard against external disruptions. By incorporating smart detection and vertical storage innovations, coupled with essential employee training on these systems, the industry can not only rise to new heights, literally and metaphorically but also contribute significantly to the broader efforts to mitigate the risks of climate change.

Technology And Foresight

Confronting the intensified challenges posed by climate-induced phenomena highlights the indispensable role of technology and strategic foresight in fortifying supply chains against adversities.

Embracing proactive measures, sustainability promotion and productive collaboration becomes imperative in navigating climate-induced hurdles while protecting global trade. These initiatives signify a fundamental shift in organizational resilience and emphasize the significance of preparedness and creativity in mitigating the risks arising from the changing climate.

In charting the course ahead, a fusion of esteemed Bill Gates quotes offers valuable guidance. Though slightly tailored to the topic at hand, the underlying ethos remains potent: embrace the adaptability to reconsider, revitalize, respond and innovate, all while recognizing that climate's impact on business could surpass the past five decades within the next 10 years.",forbes.com,49,1,US,en,"Brian Enright,Council Post,Forbes Councils Member",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c262108faa70bf6a43be4b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,12.716995,46a068b0e127a471afa1e424d61b3cff,"['Flood Risks', 'Global Supply Chains', 'Resilient Strategies']",The article discusses the increasing flood risks due to climate change and their impact on global supply chains.

James Whaley Forbes Councils Member,James Whaley,2024-02-06 13:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/06/why-consumer-brands-need-to-prioritize-b2b-research/,forbes.com,"Use B2B insights, along with B2C research, to build a holistic strategy that aligns with the values your customers care about most.","James Whaley is the CEO of OvationMR.

Consumer brand managers are no strangers to market research. Consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands often invest significant time and money in B2C market research, trying to understand their audience's individual demographics, psychographics and buying behaviors. But many miss key opportunities and advantages by stopping there, oftentimes overlooking the essential requirement of incorporating B2B research—insights into their suppliers' practices, processes and sources—to align with their customers' values and expectations.

The Importance Of B2B Insights

Consumer spending in the U.S. is over $14 trillion each year, two-thirds of the country's GDP, and consumer packaged goods make up a significant portion of purchases. In surveys, consumers consistently say they care about buying environmentally and ethically sustainable products, and they are putting their money where their mouth is.

In collaboration with NielsenIQ, McKinsey analyzed 2017 to 2022 U.S. sales data from 44,000 brands across 32 CPG categories. The study found a clear link between products, with environmental, social and governance (ESG) claims and consumer spending. Products with ESG-related claims, which accounted for 56% of all growth during the five-year period, 18% more than expected, resulted in 28% cumulative growth versus 20% for products without these claims.

Younger consumers are particularly concerned about the environmental impact of the products they buy. In a 2021 study from First Insight and the Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, 75% of Gen-Z consumers said that sustainability was more important to them than brand in their buying decisions, along with 71% of Millennials, 73% of Gen-X and 65% of Baby Boomers.

How To Improve B2B Insights

If your company primarily sells products to consumer audiences, don't fall into the common trap of thinking you don't need B2B research as part of your strategy. Our global market research firm works with both B2B and B2C clients, and my team and I believe consumer brand managers must play an integral role in discovering what is important to their customers, understanding how their suppliers source and manufacture their products and sharing information more transparently.

It's not enough to focus solely on the 4 P's: product, price, place and promotion. You need to have ongoing conversations with suppliers throughout your entire supply chain, identifying and addressing issues and partnering with them to improve processes and outcomes. I recommend starting with the following five strategies.

1. Prioritize Outreach And Engagement

Establish a regular outreach program with your B2B suppliers to discuss issues such as supply chain challenges, performance metrics and emerging trends. You likely already conduct frequent focus groups and attitude, awareness and usage studies with your customers. Expand your efforts to include your suppliers.

For example, you could send out high-level quantitative surveys on a quarterly basis and host in-depth discussions semiannually, where you ask qualitative questions such as: How would you evaluate our relationship? What are we doing well, and what can we improve? What do you want customers to know about your product? How can we work together to make positive changes in sourcing, processing, etc.?

2. Monitor Trends And Market Intelligence

Stay in step with your consumers by talking to your downstream partners about the emerging trends they are seeing. Ask what other companies are buying from them or what manufacturing processes they are using more frequently. By being proactive about tracking patterns and market dynamics, you can anticipate shifts in demand and identify new opportunities with your own products.

3. Look For Risks And Opportunities

Evaluate potential risks in your supply chain, such as the environmental impact or ethical practices of sourcing certain materials. Talk to your current suppliers about possible alternatives, and interview other suppliers you may want to build a relationship with in the future. Create supply chain contingencies in the same way that IT departments develop disaster recovery plans.

4. Use Data To Drive Decisions

Data is power. Leverage insights gathered from B2B research to inform better short- and long-term decision-making. Look at your current circumstances and future goals, and evaluate the options that are available to you. Given your time, resources and priorities, what are the next best steps forward? You may not be ready to invest the time and resources in changing suppliers right now, for instance, but you could work with your current supplier to implement new sustainability or ethical sourcing practices.

Once you start acting with intention, craft a different narrative about what you're doing in the marketplace. Tell the story of not only what you've already done but also the steps you're taking to make continuous improvements. Authenticity and transparency are key for building trust and credibility among your stakeholders, ultimately contributing to stronger relationships and brand loyalty.

5. Find The Right Partners

B2B research is a complex field that requires specialized expertise. Work with research partners who can help you create a strategic framework that helps you reach your organizational goals.

Transparency in your supply chain has never been more important—to your customers and to your bottom line.

The World Is Going Into The Red From The Red Sea Crisis,Ariel Cohen,2024-02-07 14:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2024/02/07/the-world-is-going-into-the-red-from-the-red-sea-crisis/,forbes.com,"The Houthis, an Iranian-backed proxy terrorist group in Yemen, have unleashed chaos on the global supply chain and sent shockwaves through international markets.","The Houthis, an Iranian-backed proxy terrorist group in Yemen, trained and equipped by the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran, have unleashed chaos on the global supply chain and sent shockwaves through international markets. Now that the US is attacking Iranian targets proxies in Syria and Iraq while the UK and US are bombing Houthis in the Red Sea targets. The cost to the global economy is ticking upwards.

Nearly 30 percent of global container shipping navigates through the Suez Canal via the Red Sea, with 15 percent of global trade passing through the Red Sea, mostly destined for Asia. This traffic includes not only strategic resources like oil and gas but also everyday goods and commodities that keep the global economic engine humming.

Beginning in November 2023, the Houthis launched indiscriminate attacks on commercial ships traversing the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a crucial 20-mile-wide chokepoint for maritime traffic entering and exiting the Red Sea in its South. These attacks have already rattled the global energy market. The Houthis justify these actions on the ground that they are targeting vessels associated with Israel in response to its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Western governments indicate that Houthis are attacking indiscriminately.

Cargo insurance has seen a sharp increase in rates for voyages that pass through the Red Sea. While rates were typically around 0.6 percent of the value of the cargo before the crisis, they are now up to 2 percent. Insurers have also added war risk premiums on top of the standard rate, raising the price of taking the Suez Canal route even further.

Shipping rates from North Asia to the East Coast of the U.S. have jumped 137% to $5,100 for a 40-foot container from early October, while rates from North Asia to the West Coast have jumped 131% to $3,700. China also faces issues stemming from Red Sea disruptions, as shipping costs to Europe have more than doubled to about $7,000 from $3,000 in December, 2023's $3,000, posing a huge threat to its export-driven economy.

An estimated 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea every year, worth more than $1 trillion. Shipping giants like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have begun suspending services through this area altogether opting for a longer detour around the Cape of Good Hope, which can use an additional $1 million worth of fuel cost per trip.

These shipping giants have already incurred nearly $200 million in extra fuel costs alone. The fallout from the shipping crisis is rippling through various sectors. The U.S.-based BDI Furniture has announced that it would ask freight brokers to bypass the Suez Canal and ship goods across the Pacific Ocean to California. The German chemical giant Gechem GmbH & Co KG has cut back on producing dishwasher and toilet tablets due to shortages of necessary chemicals.

In the EV industry, Tesla TSLA is halting most of its production at its Berlin because of shortages linked to the rerouted shipments. Volvo Car is also pausing production at its Ghent facility in Belgium due to supply delays.

Revenues from Egypt's Suez Canal are down 40% from the beginning of the year compared to 2023, equivalent to a loss of approximately $300 million. This has serious economic implications for Egypt as the Suez Canal has long been a crucial source of foreign currency for the country.

The effect of the crisis on inflationary pressure remains unclear. While the New York Federal Reserve's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did not suggest a significant uptick in December or January, the effects of shipping disruptions can manifest with a delay. Similarly, while the European Central Bank has maintained its projection for eurozone inflation to decrease from 5.4% in 2023 to 2.7% this year, a prolonged shutdown of the Red Sea would likely slow down the speed at which the rate of inflation returns to normal.

East African countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya are especially at risk from the crisis. They are highly reliant on wheat imports from the EU, Russia, and Ukraine, which transit through the Suez Canal. Although the shipping costs tracked by the International Grain Council's Grain and Oilseed Freight Index remains below its pandemic peak, prolonged disturbances will force consumers in this region to bear the brunt of rising food prices.

This crisis is the most severe supply chain disruption since the COVID-19 pandemic, jeopardizing the global economic recovery and potentially leading to inflation as freight and oil prices rise. The total cost of this crisis is already in the billions of dollars, and it is set to not only continue to climb, but be primarily borne by developing countries least equipped to handle it.

Even a conservative estimation of these losses, calculated by combining the lost tolls in the Suez Canal, increased externality spending in international shipping, higher international transaction costs, and higher needless fuel and food costs, is astronomical. For Europe alone, the current sum is at approximately 1 billion dollars. This amount climbs higher when one considers still forthcoming data from East Asia and America at the time of this article's publication, and soars further if potential losses are included, and and included. Losses will multiply so long as the crisis lingers.

Leak reveals Michelle Mone told government she would not benefit financially from PPE firm,David Conn,2024-02-07 14:20:05,full,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/07/leak-reveals-michelle-mone-told-government-she-would-not-benefit-financially-from-ppe-firm-medpro,theguardian.com,"Exclusive: Tory peer said she had ‘no conflicts whatsoever', five months before trust received £29m of profits","The Conservative peer 
Michelle Mone
 assured the government that she was not entitled to 'any financial benefit whatsoever' from a PPE company, five months before £29m of its profits were transferred into a trust for her benefit.
Leaked emails between Mone and the Cabinet Office reveal that a civil servant asked her to make a declaration that she had no conflict of interest in relation to the company, PPE Medpro, which she had recommended to ministers in May 2020.
Mone stated that she had 'no conflicts whatsoever' and that she was not 'entitled to any financial remuneration or financial benefit whatsoever'.
The civil servant then asked for clarification about the involvement of Mone's husband, the Isle of Man-based financial services businessman Doug Barrowman. She replied that 'Doug is a very philanthropic individual' who 'wanted to help the NHS' and was negotiating to lower the prices the government was paying for PPE.
The leaked emails raise new questions over whether Mone, who was appointed to the House of Lords 
by David Cameron in 2015
, was fully transparent about her and Barrowman's involvement and financial interest in PPE Medpro before the government awarded the company multimillion-pound contracts.
In June 2020, within weeks of Mone giving these assurances, the government awarded PPE Medpro two contracts to supply PPE, worth a total of £203m.
Three months later Barrowman was 
paid at least £65m
 from the profits on those contracts, according to documents produced by HSBC bank and seen by the Guardian. He secretly transferred £29m from those profits to an offshore trust set up to benefit Mone and her children.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) is conducting a long-running investigation into Mone and Barrowman for potential fraud and bribery offences relating to the procurement of the PPE Medpro contracts. The couple deny any wrongdoing.
Mone first approached the Cabinet Office ministers 
Michael Gove and Lord Agnew
 with an offer to supply PPE in early May 2020. Agnew referred her offer to the government's 'VIP lane', which gave high priority to companies recommended by people with political connections.
The emails between Mone and the Cabinet Office show that within a fortnight of Mone's approach to the ministers, civil servants were progressing PPE Medpro's offer to supply equipment. However, they were also seeking full disclosure about Mone and Barrowman's relationship to the company.
In an email to Mone, one civil servant, who was working in the Cabinet Office on the government's emergency response to the Covid outbreak, wrote: 'I have … been asked if you could provide a one-line statement to cover the lines we discussed so that we can document the declaration of no conflict.'
Mone replied: 'In relation to PPE Medpro Limited, I can confirm that I have no conflicts whatsoever in helping the company to achieve orders through the NHS. I am neither a shareholder of the company nor am I entitled to any financial remuneration or financial benefit whatsoever. You can put this on the record.
'My role is to help the NHS deliver on its PPE targets and to ultimately save lives of patients, medical workers and carers.'
The civil servant replied by thanking the Tory peer and asking for additional clarification about Barrowman's involvement in the company. 'Are you or Doug able to make any relevant statements relating to his involvement? I know his circumstances are different but am trying to ensure that everything is as transparent as possible.'
Mone replied half an hour later with an email stating in large text at the top: 'This is for the record.'
'To clarify the position on Doug, he has made it clear from the outset that he has put the consortium together that constitutes PPE Medpro Ltd,' she wrote. 'Behind the scenes he has significantly negotiated down the prices available to the NHS on PPE from the company. The end result is highly competitive pricing that ensures the NHS benefits from his years of experience in manufacturing, procurement and management of supply chains.
'Doug is a very philanthropic individual and his Barrowman Foundation supports schools building in Africa and he recently built a large centre in Manchester for the Prince's Trust. He is passionate about the NHS and during the crisis has wanted to help the NHS. This he has done through the procurement of a plentiful supply of cost-effective PPE.'

She added: 'I hope these statements help.' Weeks later, the contracts for £203m were completed.
Mone and Barrowman have continued to claim that the company supplied PPE at competitive prices and saved the government money. However, documents seen by the Guardian indicate that the surgical gowns, for which the government paid £122m under one of the contracts, were 
bought from the Chinese manufacturer for only £46m
.
Guardian analysis of that deal and the second contract, for the supply of face masks, suggests that PPE Medpro and the three other companies in its supply chain shared 
total profits of approximately £100m
 on the £203m contracts.

A spokesperson for Mone and Barrowman, who argue they are being 'scapegoated' for government failures in PPE procurement, said: 'The NCA investigation has been ongoing for almost three years. There were well over a thousand separate communications with HM Government/Department of 
Health
 and Social Care and the small number of messages you quote are taken out of context. Doug and Michelle deny any wrongdoing and have not been charged with any criminal offences.'
The Cabinet Office declined to comment; a government spokesperson said this was due to 'ongoing legal cases'.
In December 2023 Mone and her husband 
admitted they had lied
 to the media for years when they 
instructed lawyers to deny
 they were involved in PPE Medpro. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Barrowman acknowledged that he had made more than £60m profit from the deals, and had transferred money into the trust. The couple said Barrowman's children were also beneficiaries of the trust.
A YouTube film released in December, that was paid for by PPE Medpro and featured interviews with Mone and Barrowman, reported that

 of bribery, fraud by false representation and conspiracy to defraud.

Germany Likely To Kill EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Law,Jon McGowan,2024-02-07 18:55:28,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2024/02/07/germany-likely-to-kill-eu-corporate-sustainability-due-diligence-law/,forbes.com,"The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which expands businesses' liability in climate change and human rights, has met strong opposition from Germany.","Since 2022, the European Union has been developing new regulations relating to the responsibilities of corporations for environmental and human rights concerns. The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive expands businesses' liability, not only in their internal operations, but also in their subsidiaries and value chain. The final draft of the CS3D was released on January 20, but requires final approval by the European Parliament, European Commission, and the European Council. However, the approval appears to be meeting strong resistance from Germany, who have indicated they will abstain from CS3D, most likely killing the proposal in the Council vote on February 9.

The CS3D is part of a series of regulatory actions taken by the EU to address climate change and broader environmental, social, and governance issues. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive created ESG reporting obligations for both publicly traded and privately held businesses in the EU. The directive called for the creation of European Sustainability Reporting Standards, the detailed processes used by businesses to report under the CSRD. The drafting of the ESRS was delegated to the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group. The first round of ESRS standards were adopted in July 2023, but the adoption of additional standards soon met delays as opposition to the reporting burden on small and medium sized enterprises grew.

In September 2023, in the annual State of the Union address, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen decried the overregulation of small and medium businesses and called for a 25% reduction in reporting obligations of SMEs. This was a clear indicator that implementation of the CSRD would be delayed, and eventually reduced in scope. Notably, von der Leyen is a German politician, most recently serving as the Minister of Defense under Angela Merkel until being elected as President of the Commission in 2019.

Von der Leyen's comments were quickly followed by a proposal from Germany to decrease the CSRD requirements on SMEs by raising the threshold for reporting from 250 to 500 employees. More changes followed. In late 2023 the EU instructed EFRAG to delay work on sector-specific standards and standards for non-EU companies. Instead, it was directed to help create better guidance for the general ESRS. On January 24, the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament adopted a proposal that will delay implementation of the sector-specific standards and non-EU businesses reporting requirements of the CSRD until 2026, two years after the original implementation date.

On January 30, the EU released the final draft of the CS3D. As the name implies, the CS3D establishes a corporate due diligence standard for sustainability issues for businesses operating in the EU. In this case, sustainability most directly applies to environmental concerns, climate change, and human rights.

The proposed due diligence standard adopts a risk-based approach, where companies must identify risks where they are most severe or most likely to occur, then prioritize the order of mitigation based on severity and likelihood. Failure to act will result in regulatory liability from member states, as well as opening them up to civil litigation from those who are impacted.

For EU legislation like the CS3D, three proposals are passed, then negotiated to the final agreement. The proposals come from the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Council through individually passed legislation. Those differences in the proposals are then negotiated by representatives of each body to reach a final draft proposal that is then brought back to the original three for final approval. Once approved, member states have two years to enact it into state law.

When released on January 30, the CS3D appeared to be on track for quick approval. However, Germany announced that they will be abstaining from the CS3D, leading to concerns that the vote will fail in the Council vote.

While the opposition to sustainability requirements is the strongest from Germany, it is also the home of one of its strongest advocates. European Parliament member Axel Voss serves as rapporteur for multiple EU sustainability directives including the CSRD and the CS3D. EU press releases on these topics generally feature quotes from Voss. He is also a frequent defender of the projects in other forums.

In sharply worded press release, written in German, Voss wrote: 'A month ago everyone assumed that the law would come. This withdrawal was now largely initiated by Germany. The FDP rejects it, so the federal government has to abstain. Chancellor Scholz is once again powerless. A typical ‘German vote' as an expression of a lack of ability to act and a lack of political leadership.'

He went on to state 'It was foreseeable from the start that the EU directive was primarily a German problem. Shortly after the announcement of the EU directive, the German government at the time passed the German Supply Chain Act, which rightly became a symbol of bureaucratic madness for German companies.'

Voss took issue with many of the arguments made against the CS3D. However, he did concede that there are valid points of concern. 'In principle, one can continue to question whether supply chain laws are effective or whether now is the right time for bureaucratic laws, whether the text could be improved in the interests of competitiveness or whether implementation needs to be improved or better coordinated.'

The current final draft of the CS3D cannot be amended by the voting bodies. The vote is either to approve or reject. If the Council votes to reject, the proposal will be sent back for further negotiations.

The delay could be more than a temporary setback for the CS3D. The 2024 European Parliament election is scheduled for the beginning of June. Sustainability advocates are concerned that the composure of the body may change on this issue, removing majority support for both the CS3D and the CSRD.",forbes.com,49,1,US,en,Jon McGowan,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6515c5c5615005a1762e0a8a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@jonmcgowanFL,8.962352,042e507822b8d93854668da75c347820,"['CS3D', 'Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive', 'Germany']","The final draft of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) has been released, but Germany's resistance may lead to its rejection in the Council vote on February 9.",Yes,"The news article discusses the final draft of the CS3D, which is directly relevant to the NDA's focus on supply chain risks, health and safety risks, and potentially cybersecurity risks.",Red,"{

GM just secured enough cathode material for 5 million electric vehicles,Andrew J. Hawkins,2024-02-07 22:15:00,timezone unknown,https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23278733/gm-lg-chem-cathode-deal-ev-battery-earnings,theverge.com,GM said it will explore building a factory in North America.,"General Motors needs a lot of cathode active materials (CAM) if it's to reach its goal of making enough electric vehicles to become a completely carbon neutral company by 2040. How much is enough? How about 950,000 tons of the stuff.
GM now says it's reached a deal with LG Chem, one of South Korea's premier battery making firms, to lock down a supply of CAM starting later this year. CAM is basically what makes a battery a battery, consisting of components like processed nickel, lithium and other materials, and representing about 40 percent of the total cost of a battery cell.
CAM is basically what makes a battery a battery
The majority of EV battery cathodes are made with NCM — nickel, cobalt, and magnesium. Cobalt is 
a key component in this mix
, but it's also the most expensive material in the battery and 
mined under conditions that often violate human rights
, leading it to be called the 'blood diamond of batteries.' As a result, GM and other companies 
like Tesla
, are rushing to create a cobalt-free battery. GM's Ultium batteries, for example, will add aluminum — making the mix NCMA — and reduce the cobalt content by 70 percent.
LG Chem will begin supplying CAM to the automaker starting in the latter half of 2022 and lasting until 2030. GM says this will be enough battery material to power approximately 5 million electric vehicles, which should help the company in its quest to catch up to Tesla. 
GM has said it plans to spend $30 billion by 2025 on the creation of 30 new plug-in models in its bid to overtake Elon Musk's company as the leading EV company in the world. Tesla still dominates the relatively small EV market in the US, with around 66 percent market share, while GM only has around 6 percent. This year, the company was even outsold by legacy auto rivals like Ford and Hyundai, 
according to 
CNBC
. 
In a furious bid to catch up and become more vertically integrated, GM is trying to get a stronger grasp on its supply chain, which includes battery manufacturing. The company has said it will spend over $4 billion on the construction of 
two battery factories
 in North America in partnership with South Korea's LG Chem. 
GM said today that it will also explore localizing a CAM production facility with LG Chem by the end of 2025. Previously, the company announced that it will construct a new cathode factory in North America in a joint venture with South Korea's Posco Chemical.
The company also recently 
struck a deal to source lithium
, a key ingredient in electric-car batteries, from geothermal deposits in the US. And it's building a 
new 300,000-square-foot battery research facility
 in Michigan to help it realize its mission of building electric vehicle batteries that are longer-lasting, quicker to charge, and more sustainable for the environment.",theverge.com,189,-1,US,en,Andrew J.

"Tech Layoffs May Be A Sign Of Health, Not Sickness",Kevin O'Marah,2024-02-07 14:31:06,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinomarah/2024/02/07/tech-layoffs-may-be-a-sign-of-health-not-sickness/,forbes.com,"Layoffs reflect companies cutting COVID bloat, but for healthier businesses, they are also about pivoting to an AI productivity surge.","Despite a strong US economy and booming stock market, news headlines are loaded with stories of layoffs, especially in the tech sector. Big names like Amazon AMZN, Google GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, and Salesforce CRM have announced new job cuts already in 2024. You might think times were tough and that these companies are struggling to survive, and yet this group of four has seen their stock prices rise an average of 54.7% in the past year.

What's going on?

Getting Back in Shape

The first part of the explanation is that many companies are still trimming positions added during the Covid/war for talent' era when massive government subsidies and a sense of responsibility to employees combined to suspend normal business logic and virtually no one was laid off. Data from Layoffs.fyi shows that tech layoffs spiked in January 2024 to 30,995 which was the highest in nine months, but still well below the 89,709 cuts in January 2023. For comparison the grand total across 21 months from Q3 2020 to Q1 2022 was only 36,961.

Surging stock prices look like a reward for getting costs under control and shifting business focus from revenue growth and lofty humanitarian aspirations back to earnings. Non-tech companies including UPS, Estee Lauder Companies, and Nike NKE have also announced plans to cut jobs with a similar intent to restructure operations and get back in fighting shape. The message to investors is that efficiency is back in vogue.

Getting Ready for the AI Era

Less obvious, but potentially more important, is a need to lay the groundwork for a revolution in the way work gets done in this era of AI. Productivity gains from early targeted uses of AI have been massive including a 40-fold increase in idea generation among ChatGPT users studied by MIT, or Walmart's use of a Pactum AI chatbot to negotiate contracts with long-tail suppliers saving its internal team thousands of work hours, or Togal.AI which reduces the time estimators spend costing a building by over 90%. The common thread is that AI, applied narrowly, can radically change the amount of human work required for certain tasks.

The effect is also relevant across business processes in a more sweeping way. McKinsey has studied the impact of Generative AI on automation efforts across industries and found that it will raise productivity by 25% on average. Their research focused on specific tasks that could be sped up with AI applications as part of a wider process redesign for efficiency.

Amazon offers a relatively mature proof point of how the AI era changes productivity in an operations-intensive business. It uses AI in forecasting, route planning, materials handling, and e-commerce sales among hundreds of other areas. The business results include gaining ground through 2023 in both online sales and last mile parcel delivery with a connected system of technologies that optimizes assortments, inventory placement, load building and delivery promises.

Restructure Early and Often

The takeaway for supply chain leaders is that layoffs going forward are less about cutting costs and more about breaking bad habits. Work in specific functions like contract administration is still too labor intensive, and frankly brain-dead, for smart procurement people whose intellect is often underutilized simply because the systems haven't been updated. The same is true for predictive maintenance in manufacturing which lends itself to classical AI but is still too often done by experienced people whose time could be better spent tuning robotic processes than firefighting machinery glitches.

These kinds of jobs were designed for an era of mass production where IT systems like ERP and PDM took years to implement and were nearly impossible to change. That era is over. Moving big chunks of this application support to the cloud makes AI much easier to add where appropriate, and to update continuously as competitive conditions change.

Layoffs in this context are about restructuring not once a decade, but constantly as new uses of AI are identified and rolled out for specific tasks. The best path for supply chain leaders may be leaning into it by seeking out and leading high impact AI task overhauls.",forbes.com,49,3,US,en,Kevin O'Marah,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c393ac7d5303581f53f88f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3202,1803,x0,y82,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@forbes,8.718355,190b6602b3e677bf88dbfc0e09c5e125,"['layoffs', 'tech sector', 'stock prices', 'efficiency', 'AI era']","Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce have announced job cuts despite their rising stock prices.

North Korea
 that raked in $3bn to help it further develop its nuclear weapons programme, according to excerpts of an unpublished UN report reviewed by the Reuters news agency.
'The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) continued to flout security council sanctions,' a panel of independent sanctions monitors reported to a security council committee, using North Korea's formal name.
'The panel is investigating 58 suspected DPRK cyber-attacks on cryptocurrency-related companies between 2017 and 2023, valued at approximately $3 billion, which reportedly help fund DPRK's WMD development,' according to the monitors, who report twice a year to the 15-member security council.
North Korea's mission to the UN in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on sanctions monitors' the report. Pyongyang has previously denied allegations of hacking or other cyber-attacks.
The UN report was due to be released publicly this month or early next month, diplomats said.
North Korean hacking groups subordinate to Pyongyang's primary foreign intelligence agency reportedly continued with a high number of cyber-attacks, the sanctions monitors said.
'Trends include DPRK targeting of defence companies and supply chains, and increasingly sharing infrastructure and tools,' the monitors said.
North Korea 'further developed nuclear weapons and produced nuclear fissile materials, although its last known nuclear test took place in 2017', wrote the monitors, who also said Pyongyang had continued ballistic missile launches, put a satellite into orbit and added a 'tactical nuclear attack submarine' to its arsenal.
North Korea has long been banned from conducting nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by the 15-member security council. Since 2006 it has been subject to UN sanctions, which the council has repeatedly strengthened to try to cut off funding for developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
Any further action against North Korea by the council is unlikely as it has been deadlocked for several years on the issue. China and Russia instead want the sanctions to be eased to convince Pyongyang to return to denuclearisation talks.
Moscow and Pyongyang also vowed in 2023 to deepen military relations. The US has 
accused North Korea of supplying weapons to Russia
 for its war in Ukraine, which North Korea and Russia have denied.
'The panel is investigating reports from member states about supplies by DPRK of conventional arms and munitions in contravention of sanctions,' the sanctions monitors wrote.
The isolated country imposed a strict lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic that slashed its trade and aid access, but has begun to recover over the last year.
'The 2023 overall recorded trade volume surpassed the total for 2022, accompanied by the reappearance of a large variety of foreign consumer goods, some of which could be classified as luxury items,' the sanctions monitors wrote.
The sale or transfer of luxury items to North Korea has long been banned by the security council. Under UN sanctions imposed in 2017, all countries were also required to repatriate North Koreans working abroad to stop them earning foreign currency for Kim Jong-un's regime.
'The panel investigated reports of numerous DPRK nationals working overseas earning income in violation of sanctions, including in the information technology, restaurant, and construction sectors,' the sanctions monitors wrote.
They also said North Korea continues to access the international financial system and engage in illicit financial operations in violation of UN security council resolutions.",theguardian.com,60,4,GB,en,"Reuters,ter",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b7aca59f6118040b834cda70bcfd580f141dd7f/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af93d4f4984c44fb2cfd9484870df904,False,@guardian,8.53029,68a4cf7b7a7c09bdb4b2edcfcc7a9cf3,"['North Korea', 'cyber-attacks', 'UN sanctions', 'nuclear weapons', 'WMD development']",UN sanctions monitors are investigating dozens of suspected cyber-attacks by North Korea that raked in $3bn to help it further develop its nuclear weapons programme.,Yes,"The article discusses North Korea's cyber-attacks, which is relevant to the NDA's focus on cybersecurity risks.

Spirit AeroSystems has said it is changing some of the suppliers to its Northern Ireland operations as a cost cutting measure.
It is unclear whether the cuts will have any impact on local suppliers.
The move concerns the Airbus A220 because Spirit, a US-based company, makes the wings for that plane in Belfast.
Speaking on Tuesday, Spirit's chief executive, Patrick Shanahan, said: ""The negotiations with Airbus continue and have been productive. 
""We hope to conclude by February, but we need to ensure all items are addressed. 
""We are converging on operational and financial solutions.""

The deal ended a long period of uncertainty for about 3,000 workers in Northern Ireland.
Mr Shanahan told financial analysts that the firm was looking at cost savings from work coming out of the old Bombardier supply chain and going to Airbus suppliers.
""We've jointly evaluated those costs, and Airbus has a significant history with those suppliers. So I feel confident in that cost basis,"" he added.
He was speaking as the firm reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 which included another $58m (£46m) of losses related to the A220.

Danish windfarm firm Ørsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend,Alex Lawson,2024-02-07 11:40:34,full,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/07/danish-windfarm-firm-orsted-jobs-dividend-north-sea,theguardian.com,Company developing world's largest offshore windfarm in North Sea attempts to recover from turbulent year,"The Danish company developing the world's largest offshore windfarm in the North Sea is to cut hundreds of jobs and pause its dividend in an attempt to recover from a chaotic 12 months.
Ørsted, which is behind the £8bn Hornsea 3 project off the 
Yorkshire
 coast, said on Wednesday it planned to axe up to 800 jobs, pull back from markets in Spain, Portugal and Norway and suspend dividend payments to shareholders covering the 2023-25 financial years.
The company said it would cut its target for developing renewable energy capacity by 2030, reducing it from 50 gigawatts to 35-38GW.
Its chair, Thomas Thune Andersen, will step down after almost a decade in the role, following the 
two senior executives who left the business 
in November.
The company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the 'reset plan' was designed to make it a 'leaner and more efficient company'.
Ørsted has struggled in the face of high inflation, supply-chain disruption and rising interest rates, which have hit the windfarm industry. The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits.
Last year, 
Ørsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US
, the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, blaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (£3.3bn) hit has a result of the decision.
The company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December it reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to about 3.3m homes.
The RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expected Ørsted to tap investors for funds, 'which would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard'.
He added: 'However, we now have a period where Ørsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to improve its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.'

The problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to 
stop work
 on the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable.
Separately on Wednesday, the Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn – down from $17bn a year earlier but ahead of City forecasts – due to lower energy prices.
The new chief executive of BP 
said on Tuesday
 the oil and gas company would take a 'more pragmatic' approach to reaching its green targets. Shell faced calls to speed up its investment in renewable energy last week, as it

How Goodera Redefines Employee Volunteering Experiences Worldwide,Afdhel Aziz,2024-02-06 16:00:06,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2024/02/06/how-goodera-redefines-employee-volunteering-experiences-worldwide/,forbes.com,"Goodera aspires to be the Airbnb of employee volunteering, connecting its mission to engage the global workforce with volunteering with an unparalleled global infrastructure.","Goodera aspires to be the Airbnb of employee volunteering, connecting its mission to engage the global workforce with volunteering with an unparalleled global infrastructure. Every day the organization hosts and executes carefully curated corporate volunteering programs, creating engaging experiences for every workplace while serving nonprofit needs and maximizing impact in communities worldwide.

Virginia Tenpenny, the President for North America and Chief Impact Officer at Goodera, joined me to talk about her dynamic journey that led her to Goodera, where she aims to revolutionize employee volunteering, forging powerful connections between corporations and communities for global positive impact.

Tenpenny's journey into the realm of corporate social impact began in the early 2000s, marked by a pivotal moment when she discovered an opportunity to travel the world and train factories on human rights requirements for Nordstrom. Like many fresh college grads, in the early 2000s, she set out to build a career that would help make the world a better place. After college, she spent two years teaching English overseas, and her travels across Asia, Africa, and South America inspired her to explore careers that would help make the world a better place.

'I was one semester into graduate school when a friend shared a job description that turned out to be a breakthrough. Nordstrom was looking for someone to travel around the world, training its factories on human rights requirements to ensure its supply chain met Fair Labor Association standards. A prime example of the value of business and nonprofits working together to make the world better,' Tenpenny recollected.

For a young idealist, this experience underscored the potential of business, and more broadly capitalism, to drive positive outcomes for the world's most vulnerable.

Subsequently, at Starbucks, where she served as Chief Social Impact Officer, Tenpenny learned the breadth and scope of people impacted through business throughout the supply chain, employees–and, by extension, communities, particularly when a business mobilizes its people to strengthen those communities. 'At Starbucks, I worked with leaders across the company to design how best to deploy its resources and brand to improve the employee experience and create value for all stakeholders,' she added.

Taking a break post-pandemic to focus on family, Tenpenny reemerged with a renewed sense of purpose, eager to help companies maximize their impact and show the interdependence between taking care of people and delivering profit. Her path led her to Goodera, a global organization with roots and an engine in India that uses technology and innovation to help companies scale their volunteer efforts worldwide, supercharging the impact and missions of companies and nonprofits.

Inspired by the interdependence between people's well-being and business success, Tenpenny found Goodera's mission aligned with her vision of creating meaningful connections between companies and communities. 'Goodera helps companies bring their corporate purpose to life through volunteer programs that take direct action toward a cause, connect and strengthen team bonds, and power a company's impact agenda. Unlike other corporate initiatives that have recently come under fire, volunteering is not controversial or political, yet scaling and managing volunteer programs can be cost-prohibitive,' Tenpenny explained.

Through technology and a sophisticated global infrastructure, Goodera trains local community hosts, matches volunteer interests with vetted nonprofits, and implements volunteer programs that serve nonprofit needs and maximize positive impact. Goodera serves as an extension to clients' teams to manage the end-to-end volunteer programs and deliver impact reporting that enables storytelling, enhances employee trust, and strengthens a brand.

Tenpenny delved into Goodera's model and innovation that sets it apart, 'Technology and innovation have disrupted many sectors and experiences, yet volunteerism has remained somewhat cumbersome for companies to manage at scale. Goodera started to service clients in India and realized the model and tech could scale to serve corporate clients around the world. Today Goodera works with over 400 companies, has a network of 50,000 nonprofits, and has engaged over 1 million volunteers in 100 countries.'

Last year, Goodera worked with Fortune 100 companies to launch 'Champions of Change' programs to provide both the technology and organizational infrastructure support to sustain volunteer efforts. Volunteerism is correlated with positive mental health outcomes, better team performance, and brand loyalty when employees feel part of a bigger mission. With Goodera, clients have integrated volunteering across the employee experience from onboarding through becoming an alum and remaining connected to the company and its people.

'At Goodera we recognize that individual communities are often best positioned to solve their challenges. We've launched a program for social innovators to identify solutions and get help to scale their ideas. Co-creation and innovation are key tenets that guide our work, and through listening to companies, nonprofits, and communities, we're able to design meaningful and impactful experiences,' she noted.

Looking ahead, Goodera aims to collaborate with companies fostering a purpose-driven culture. 'Our sweet spot is working with companies that have, or want to build, a corporate culture that connects people to a sense of purpose and supports causes people to care about. While company interests are served, the goal is to connect people to causes and their communities in meaningful ways. We serve the internal teams managing these programs by bringing technology and innovation to enhance the adoption and credibility of these efforts,' Tenpenny explained.

Beyond providing technology and infrastructure, the organization aspires to build a community of practitioners, sharing best practices, and workshops that accelerate this work inside a company. 'We also make volunteering accessible and a core part of the employee experience. We've seen the impact when companies make volunteering something more than an annual event. Volunteering becomes integrated into employee onboarding, development opportunities, team meetings, and kiosks in and outside the office,' Tenpenny added. The ultimate objective of Goodera is to mobilize a global cohort of community leaders, catalyzing a broader movement of meaningful volunteering that strengthens the bond among people and their communities.

As for advice to leaders navigating the challenges of the current moment, Tenpenny emphasized, 'My advice is to listen to people across the organization, provide forums and guidance for people to explore their personal purpose, and identify a shared purpose for the team or organization. Then co-create rituals and ongoing occasions to nurture the purpose and causes that matter to people. Design experiences that allow for people's highest level of contribution and reflect together to absorb the shared experience.' The key, according to Tenpenny, is to repeat these practices regularly and adapt as needed.",forbes.com,49,1,US,en,Afdhel Aziz,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c0c438df05752afd01692b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@afdhelaziz,7.632626,bd8e59f852013fda1696031852007f87,"['employee volunteering', 'corporate social impact', 'supply chain']",Goodera aims to revolutionize employee volunteering by connecting corporations with communities for global positive impact.

Service Lifecycle Management: The Future Of Manufacturing Automation,Malik Saadi,2024-02-07 11:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/07/service-lifecycle-management-the-future-of-manufacturing-automation/,forbes.com,"Although only a handful of third parties are currently capitalizing on the SLM void, ABI Research expects many more to appear in the coming years.","Malik Saadi, Vice President, Strategic Technologies, ABI Research.

Today, automation/robotics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) find themselves focusing primarily on scaling product development and innovating their solutions as demand increases. Unfortunately, this can negatively impact the vendor's ability to provide product lifecycle services that enterprises require upon purchase. Therefore, third-party Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) providers are an essential partner of automation providers going forward.

Below is ABI Research's understanding of what is required of the automation/robotics industry to unlock its full potential in the future:

Product Innovation Takes Precedence: While manufacturing represents the most immense market opportunity for automation, vendors must also cater to other industries, such as retail warehousing, supply chain, construction, agriculture, real estate, retail and other emerging markets. As demand for automated/robotics solutions increases across many verticals, vendors must focus on product development and innovation to remain competitive in the future.

Customer Centricity Cannot Be Neglected: This resource realignment will impede post-sales service quality, such as customer support tickets, maintenance, operations and training. At the same time, failing to offer these customer-centric services will cause the manufacturing industry to hesitate to adopt automated solutions.

Third Parties Are Essential For Quality Post-Sales Services: Automation vendors must provide scalable, flexible and replicable solutions across many use cases, environments and regions. To concurrently meet the demand for post-sales services, vendors must build long-term partnerships with SLM providers. Once a relatively rare arrangement designated for limited use cases, the future of automation hinges upon these third-party SLM arrangements to deliver the perks that manufacturers expect from vendors.

Changing Market Ecosystem: Relying on third parties for customer assistance will cause a foundational shift in the automation market, as it will be split between vendors for product development and ecosystem partners for value-added services.

What Is SLM?

SLM includes all the services an enterprise requires for technology adoption, such as prospecting, design & planning, implementation integration with legacy infrastructure, compliance with regulations and safety frameworks, maintenance, workforce training, etc. SLM is an essential factor for enterprises when choosing an automation technology partner. To many enterprises, automation/robotics adoption is a new project they are unfamiliar with, necessitating expert help on-demand.

For these reasons, ABI Research sees third-party SLM providers as must-have partners of automation vendors with an eye on the future.

Challenges After Purchasing Automated Solutions

Automation OEMs should first step in the shoes of potential manufacturing customers and consider their main challenges regarding automation/robotics adoption.

Installation Difficulties: Site-wide automation/robotics is a new implementation for many companies, making the installation process challenging without outside help. Additionally, hardware and software solutions often have interoperability issues due to their heterogeneous nature. Manufacturers also require any new solution to be backward compatible with their legacy infrastructure and enterprise resources planning systems.

Maintenance And Repair Costs: Robotics systems are bound to require maintenance/repairs, with 81% of manufacturers reporting robot-led production shutdowns. Paying for maintenance/repairs inevitably lengthens the time it takes for a return on investment (ROI) to materialize. While larger companies can wait years for the ROI, the wider manufacturing industry requires a shorter path to recouping costs.

Data Analytics Inefficiencies: Data analytics is a big selling point for vendors, but many solutions lack context and timeliness. Manufacturers seek automated solutions that they can act upon swiftly.

Failed Deployments: Due to technological complexity issues, initial automation deployments can carry a high risk of failure. Manufacturers need assurance that their automation partner will provide ongoing assistance with remedying algorithm failure and other technical problems.

Employee Training: Different departments have different levels of technical knowledge, and manufacturing sites differ in equipment requirements. This makes employee training needs diverse in nature.

Opportunities With Third-Party SLM Providers

It's been reported that 61% of industrial companies lack experience with automation, making post-sales services crucial to your potential customers. The challenges outlined in the previous section can be alleviated through a partnership between automation/robotics vendors and third-party service providers. The latter allows the former to offer manufacturers robust SLM, making these strategic partnerships the future of automation.

Outsource Installation Process: Automation vendors typically must provide installation assistance for engineering teams across multiple regions, increasing travel and integration costs. Partnering with specialized SLM providers makes more sense for ensuring efficient merging between different and/or legacy-to-new hardware stacks in these scenarios.

Software Integration: The customized software offered by most automation vendors lacks compatibility with other robotic systems, management systems (e.g., warehouse management system (WMS) and enterprise resources planning (ERP) solutions) and external information technology (IT) infrastructure. Outside experts specializing in software interoperability can significantly streamline the onboarding process for manufacturing customers.

Reduce Burden Of Repairs: SLM providers can manage all the maintenance calls your manufacturing clients place, resulting in quicker assistance and reduced operational costs.

Robotics-As-A-Service (RaaS): A great differentiator for automation vendors would be to offer a RaaS model whereby customers get customer service, 24/7 hotlines, on-site inspections and consulting, employee training, installation, operations and redeployment from a single vendor. It's unrealistic for most automation/robotics vendors to provide all these services alone, making strategic partnerships with third-party SLMs that assist with onboarding and post-sales functions an advantage.

Future Outlook For Automation In Manufacturing

Manufacturers are increasingly adopting automated solutions such as robotics to address complex technology supply chains, rising labor costs in regions historically known for their cost-effective workforce (like parts of Asia, notably China), growing geopolitical tensions and the need to cater to multiple stakeholders.

Automation vendors will find it difficult to balance their product scalability and innovation aspirations with a full SLM plan on their own. In light of that, automation vendors that fully understand the value of third parties are ahead of the curve and hold the most tremendous promise for market capture. Although only a handful of third parties are currently capitalizing on the SLM void, ABI Research expects many more to appear in the coming years.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,1,US,en,"Council Post,Forbes Councils Member,Malik Saadi",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c272d71f2f76207548e581/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,7.5718803,54ff43b2d26e75b0af767c98cdf561ce,"['Automation/Robotics', 'Service Lifecycle Management', 'Post-sales services']","Automation/robotics OEMs must focus on product innovation and customer centricity, while also partnering with third-party Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) providers to meet the demand for post-sales services.

Sustainability in healthcare: the impact of the health sector on the environment,David Cox,2024-02-07 11:45:00,timezone unknown,https://www.theguardian.com/care-means-the-world/2023/dec/22/sustainability-in-healthcare-the-impact-of-the-health-sector-on-the-environment,theguardian.com,"From CT scans to anaesthesia, healthcare has a bigger carbon footprint than aviation. Will Cop28, with its aim to curb the sector's global emissions, accelerate change?","A pledge to do no harm is often central to oaths taken by medical students on their way to becoming doctors. It's a tenet that dates back to Hippocrates and the Ancient Greeks – but is it still being followed?
As the climate crisis intensifies and new information comes to light, it seems that the global healthcare industry, with its vast carbon footprint, needs to take action now to protect those it serves.
Climate change is described by a 
recent report
 in the Lancet medical journal as the biggest worldwide health threat of the 21st century. Growing rates of long-term illnesses are being triggered by 
air pollution
 and more 
communities find themselves living in disaster zones
 as a result of global warming.
The contribution of the world's health systems is significant. In 2019, a 
now landmark report
 calculated that healthcare's total carbon footprint is equivalent to 4.4% of global net greenhouse gas emissions, almost 
twice that of the aviation industry
. To put this into perspective, if the healthcare sector were a country, 
it would be the fifth largest emitter on the planet
.
Four years on, there is increasing international awareness among health and climate leaders. Cop28 recently released the first ever 
declaration to place health at the heart of climate action
 and accelerate the development of climate-resilient and sustainable health systems, with significant emissions reduction across the sector.
Multinational corporations are taking note too, with Philips Healthcare vocalising the need for sustainable change in healthcare through its newly launched 
Care Means the World
 platform, and also leading a number of initiatives.

'There's a global momentum within the healthcare industry now,' says 
Robert Metzke
, global head of sustainability at Philips, who attended Cop28. 'A huge number of care providers are realising the need to tackle their impact on the environment. Whether it is using less energy and materials or producing less waste. Or adopting a circular approach by choosing products with eco design at their core and extending the lifetime of a piece of equipment.
'Our hospital customers tell us they want to commit to becoming carbon neutral, but healthcare is in the early stages of the journey, and many don't know where to begin.' He suggests that conducting sustainability audits can often be an important starting point.
He adds: 'Ultimately, it's about moving away from a single-use mindset and embracing circularity. To make a lasting change, procuring with sustainability criteria in mind is critical. Only then can we look after the patient and the planet in equal measure.'
At a glance, healthcare might not seem an obvious contributor to emissions, but there are many energy-intensive aspects to it. These include the energy required to power and heat hospitals, and run the machinery within them.
Research also shows that 
around 25%
 of total healthcare emissions originate from energy consumed in manufacturing supply chains, such as those producing drugs and vaccines. But there are other less obvious sources too. NHS England's annual carbon footprint has been placed at 
25m tonnes,
 with contributing factors including gases such as nitrous oxide, used as anaesthetics, emissions relating to waste disposal, and patients using inhalers that rely on carbon-based propellants.
The NHS plans to reach net zero through methods such as using hydrogen-electric zero-emission ambulances.

So how can we go about decarbonising healthcare while still ensuring patient safety, and without drastically increasing costs? 
A paper
 in the New England Journal of Medicine in April drew attention to the 'cost myth' around reducing healthcare emissions.
The authors reported suggestions that initiatives such as installing solar power, waste reduction schemes and the long-term purchase of renewable energy could ultimately yield a positive return on investment, and would reduce greenhouse gases. In the medium term, this might mean more stable energy prices. In the long term, investing in climate solutions now would save money by reducing the need to treat patients for climate-related illnesses such as chronic lung diseases caused by air pollution.
There are plenty of other areas where improvements are possible. 
Research conducted by Philips Healthcare
, in partnership with Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, in Nashville, investigated the carbon emissions of 13 diagnostic imaging devices, including MRI, CT, ultrasound and X-ray, which together account for about 12,000 patient scans a month. The research found that over a decade they emit as much CO2 as 1,000 petrol cars being driven for a year. The project suggested that implementing sustainable initiatives could help address this problem. Initial results indicated that rather than replacing imaging devices, upgrading or refurbishing them offered the twin benefits of reducing carbon emissions and the cost of ownership.
In future, AI may help hospitals to reduce emissions by, for example, accurately reading minute details on scans and 
identifying when repeats are unnecessary
. Next generation devices such as Philips Incisive CT are 
more energy efficient
 than their predecessors and embed AI within the system to improve precision in the radiation dose and enhance image quality, reducing the need for repeat scans.
While cutting healthcare emissions will not be straightforward, a commitment to change seems to be emerging. At Cop28, the WHO director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 
acknowledged the need to build low-carbon health systems
, while NHS England has outlined 
a plan for reaching net zero
 by 2040 for emissions it controls directly, and 2045 for wider emissions. This will involve increasing the use of solar panels and ultra-low emission vehicles, including hydrogen-electric zero-emission ambulances. There are also plans to 
decommission desflurane
 – an anaesthetic with a global warming potential 2,500 times greater than that of CO2. The 
Greener NHS programme
, meanwhile, is working with catering leads and suppliers to increase the provision of locally sourced food for patients and staff to cut transport-related emissions.
There are still significant challenges afoot, but positive signs are also emerging from the pharmaceutical industry. The 
Sustainable Markets Initiative Health Systems Task Force
 reports being 
in advanced discussions
 with energy providers in China and India to scale renewable power across many of the supply chains used to procure vital raw materials for medicines. The task force, a public-private partnership of CEOs and healthcare leaders, also says it has set minimum environmental targets for 100 of the world's largest pharmaceutical suppliers. These targets, it adds, have the potential to address 3.5m tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.
The Cop28 UAE Climate and Health Declaration, signed by 123 countries, can be seen as a breakthrough in the fight to decrease healthcare emissions. The problem is urgent, but if healthcare professionals worldwide act quickly, globally, and collectively, it is one that can be addressed. Then the international healthcare industry can feel it is walking in the footsteps of Hippocrates – for the good of the planet and every person on it.

COMMENTARY: A Pinch of Salt Could Unsettle Electric-Car Order,Katrina Hamlin,2024-02-07 17:20:47,full,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/pinch-salt-could-unsettle-electric-car-order-2024-02-07/,reuters.com,"By Katrina Hamlin Table salt is pictured in this illustration following the Food and Drug Administration's new guidelines for sodium intake in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S.,…","By

HONG KONG, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) – It is a truth only 
recently acknowledged
 by Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk and his rivals that Chinese carmakers are eating their lunch. But a pinch of salt might unsettle the auto industry's new world order all over again. Brands from 
BYD
 (1211.HK), (002594.SZ) to French-Italian 
Stellanti
s (STLAM.MI) are betting on sodium for electric batteries. The tech could accelerate electrification – and might loosen China's grip on the industry, too.

Sodium can be used as the key ingredient in electric-vehicle batteries, replacing lithium, used in most of today's EVs. The process is roughly the same. Ions, which are electrically charged atoms, move through a liquid electrolyte, allowing the unit to store or release energy. However, using sodium makes the process faster than most lithium – or nickel-based models. Sodium battery packs can reach 80% of capacity in 
just 15 minutes
, the time a Tesla Supercharger takes to charge a car for a 275 km trip. Sodium batteries hold up better in colder temperatures, too.

Most enticingly, sodium is a cheaper alternative to lithium. That's because it is easily found in salt and soda ash, making it the 
sixth most abundant
 element on earth. While there are just over 100 million metric tons of known lithium resources in the world, there are tens of billions of tons of soda ash, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In 2022, the cost of a sodium-ion battery pack was as low as $90 per kilowatt of energy stored, while cells using lithium were 30% to 40% more expensive, Wood Mackenzie 
noted
.

On the downside, sodium-based batteries hold only about half as much energy per kilogram as their lithium counterparts. That means that larger power packs are needed to carry the weight of a Tesla Model Y or a BYD Seal over long distances. However, beyond a certain point, it is not possible to fit an oversized battery into a conventional chassis without disturbing the delicate balance of mass, proportion and aerodynamics. Consequently, unless there is a major tech breakthrough, cars using this material will have a shorter range than many models available on the market today.

Those qualities meant sodium was largely neglected in the early days of electric vehicles, despite decades of research into its potential. But companies became less concerned about its shortcomings when the price of lithium and other key battery metals soared in 2021. The rally acted as a catalyst for the first wave of commercialisation. Industry leader CATL (300750.SZ) announced plans for cheaper sodium-ion packs that same year, and started to deliver the new products to Chinese auto giant Chery in April 2023.

POWER STRUGGLE


Western players will see advantages beyond affordability. China's grip over crucial battery metals allows it to dominate the entire electric-car supply chain. The country could secure access to 
around a third
 of the world's lithium mine production by 2025, while Chinese companies already accounted for 
72%
 of the metal's global refining capacity in 2022.

Replacing lithium with sodium offers a chance to rebalance. The United States holds over 90% of the world's known reserves of soda ash, the most cost-efficient source, 
says
 the U.S. Geological Survey. China has started using the synthetic alternatives, but extracting sodium from natural sources can halve the cost, emit 70% less carbon dioxide, and consume nearly 80% less water, 
according to
 Turkish producer WE Soda.

Supply chains are not the only factor that could see this tech tilt the centre of gravity away from China. Sodium-based batteries are suited to smaller, cheaper four-wheelers, scooters and energy storage solutions. Demand for such products is growing in India and Southeast Asia. That may favour local champions like Mumbai's Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), which bought a British startup focused on sodium in 2021.

Salt is still in its salad days. Battery manufacturers had announced a grand total of 
158 gigawatt hours
 of annual production capacity as of August, according to Wood Mackenzie: that's only a little more than Musk's Nevada gigafactories 
can make
 each year. Even so, sodium ion's geopolitical advantages are too tempting to ignore.

CONTEXT NEWS


French-Italian carmaker Stellantis announced on Jan. 12 that it is investing in European startup Tiamat, which produces batteries based on sodium, commonly found in salt and soda ash. The exact amount of the investment, which is part of an initial 150 million euro fundraising, was not disclosed.

China's electric auto manufacturer BYD has started construction on a plant in Jiangsu to build batteries based on sodium ions, electrically charged atoms. The factory, with total investment of 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), has a planned annual capacity of 30 gigawatt hours, Reuters reported on Jan. 5.

Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries agreed to buy British startup Faradion, which specialises in sodium-ion batteries, for 100 million pounds in December 2021.

The world's largest battery maker, China's CATL, first unveiled its sodium batteries in 2021, and has since started to deliver sodium-ion products to customers.

Weather data casts doubt on government's claim over fall in migrant crossings,Megan Riddell,2024-02-07 11:06:12,full,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68216757,bbc.co.uk,New figures raise questions about government claims the weather had no impact on 2023 crossings falling.,"Image source, 
PA Media
New figures obtained by BBC Verify have raised questions about the government's claims that poor weather conditions had no impact on a fall in small boat crossings across the Channel.
The number of successful crossings by migrants decreased by a third in 2023.
The government later ruled out weather conditions as a reason for the fall.
But a Met Office report for UK Border Force suggests there were more days in 2023 than in 2022 when migrants were unlikely to cross due to the weather.
The number of migrants crossing the Channel fell by about 36% last year - falling from 45,774 in 2022, to 29,437 in 2023.
Last month, Home Secretary James Cleverly told BBC Breakfast that weather was not a ""contributory factor"" to falling numbers of migrants crossing the Channel. 
He said the decrease was instead down to greater co-operation with Europe and ""going after"" people smugglers.
BBC Verify has now obtained official weather reports given to UK Border Force, following a Freedom of Information request.
The reports were prepared by the Met Office, and assessed how likely migrant crossings were to happen in the Channel for every day of 2022 and 2023.
Experts assessed a range of weather conditions, such as wave height and temperature, and each day was then categorised by how favourable Channel conditions were for migrants looking to make a crossing.
The categories ranged from ""highly unlikely"" - meaning Met Office officials considered sea conditions to be poor - to ""highly likely"".
The report reveals the number of days with the very worst conditions to make a crossing on, called ""highly unlikely"", increased by about 50% in 2023. Arrivals on these days were very low, at about three people a day on average.
The number of ""highly likely"" days fell by a quarter - these days saw an average of 248 people crossing.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast on 2 January, Mr Cleverly said there were 102 ""good sailing days"" in 2023, compared with 106 the previous year. 
The official report shows Mr Cleverly combined the number of ""likely"" and ""high likely"" days over each year. However, that number does not factor in any change in the number of unlikely, or highly unlikely days.
In October 2023, former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick also claimed weather conditions ""were more favourable to small boat crossings than those in 2022"".
Peter Walsh, senior researcher at Oxford University's Migration Observatory, told the BBC the new figures suggested weather was certainly 'a factor'. 
However, he added: ""The importance of weather as a factor is unknown, and is difficult to disentangle from a whole range of other factors that could be driving small boat arrivals.""
Other potential influences include the conditions in the countries where people travel from, including places like Afghanistan or Albania, the time it takes people to get to crossing points, as well as enforcement activity by France and Belgium.
Mr Cleverly linked the decrease in migrant crossings to co-operation with countries such as France and Albania, and the government's efforts to disrupt the supply chains and finances of criminal gangs.
A spokesperson for the home secretary said Mr Cleverly had been clear in subsequent interviews that while the weather was ""always a factor in human activity effecting, as it does, everyone, everywhere all of the time"" it was not a significant factor in the fall in small boat arrivals.
""That fall is because we know the work we are doing, the French are doing, and partners across Europe are doing, to disrupt and frustrate the criminal smuggling gangs,"" they added.
But Lucy Moreton, from the ISU, a union representing border force staff, said it was ""difficult, if not impossible"" to say there was a precise cause of the reduction in migrant numbers last year.
""The statistics bear out that the weather has limited crossings in 2023,"" she said. ""It is true that the weather conditions for crossing were less favourable leading to fewer crossing days. 
""It is also true that the French, funded by the UK government, have been more effective in their efforts to prevent boats setting to sea.""
As well as successful crossings, the number of attempted border-crossing to the UK on small boats also fell last year. In 2023, about 62,000 attempts were made, down from 70,000, according to Frontex, the EU border agency.

How The Demand For EV Charging Infrastructure Is Transforming Business Models,Doron Frenkel,2024-02-06 14:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/06/how-the-demand-for-ev-charging-infrastructure-is-transforming-business-models/,forbes.com,Key players are transforming and extending their business models to thrive in the emerging EV era.,"Doron Frenkel, founder and CEO of Driivz, a leading EV Charging and Energy Management Platform.

Reports of the decline in electric vehicle are ""exaggerated,"" according to a forecast by S&P Global. EV sales are projected to reach 16.2% of total vehicle sales in 2024, compared to 12% in 2023, the forecast also said. From my view, the rate of growth is likely to be slower as two big obstacles to adoption remain: high EV prices and range anxiety around the lack of EV charging infrastructure. Yet, in 2024, I expect to see progress on both fronts as the EV market moves from early adopters to early consumers.

Lower-priced EV models are on the way. More significantly, as EVs penetrate more customer segments, I believe we will see EV charging infrastructure growth that is increasingly shaped and accelerated by three industry segments: commercial real estate and big-box retail, oil and gas, and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As the founder of an EV charging and energy management platform that works with these industries, I'm seeing key players transforming and extending their business models to thrive in the emerging EV era.

This is good news. As I see it, EVs are here to stay, and any slowdown in the rate of growth will likely be temporary. I expect to see more private capital flowing into EV charging infrastructure development (along with government funding), while emerging partnerships help the entire ecosystem grow. This includes EV charging network operators, EV service equipment manufacturers, software providers and support businesses like installers and repair networks.

For decades now, automobile drivers have traveled to a specific place, the gas station, for the primary purpose of refueling. Except for making charging stops on long journeys, I believe EV culture is changing this pattern and, in doing so, shifting the way energy is delivered to vehicles. I have observed more EV drivers adopting a 'charge when you park' lifestyle.

Commercial real estate developers, property management companies, multiple dwelling unit developers, shopping malls and big-box retailers, restaurant chains, public parking operators and workplaces can all fall under the 'park and charge' umbrella. This means the parking lot becomes the 'gas station' and can service EV drivers as they work, shop and dine.

Business models for providing EV charging will depend on a company's willingness to depart from its core competency. I anticipate many companies will partner with established EV charging network operators, as we are seeing with convenience stores and quick-service restaurants. Others will do like Walmart, which is building its own network of fast-charging stations at its 5,000-plus stores and Sam's Club warehouses. While companies can generate new revenue from EV charging, the real payoff for these 'gas stations of the future' will be customer satisfaction, green brand positioning and potentially even the ability to attract employees who are looking for this type of benefit.

Oil And Gas: Making Major Investments In Fast Charging

Electrification presents both a threat and an opportunity for oil and gas companies, including fuel and convenience retailers. Cash-rich global O&G megacompanies are investing significantly in fuel alternatives to gasoline and diesel, renewables and building new EV charging infrastructure. These investments include acquisitions of charging provider s; partnerships, like the one between BP and Hertz, to expand their reach; and equipment manufacturers for vertical integration.

The default evolution is to leverage brand loyalty by adding direct current fast charging to existing fuel retail locations to capture on-the-go charging revenue. The increased dwell time for EV charging is also spurring the enhancement of attached convenience stores to entice drivers and increase sales with a better experience and expanded food offerings. Beyond that, some O&G companies had previously established EV charging-focused business units to offer solutions for home charging.

Automotive OEMs: From EV Manufacturers To End-To-End EV Solution Providers

Early on, OEMs focused on designing and manufacturing EVs and left charging to EV charging networks and home charging vendors. The exception, Tesla, built and bundled a proprietary charging network to encourage EV adoption and increase sales. That approach worked, and I believe it set expectations that charging should come with EVs.

In response, some OEMs are shifting to become end-to-end EV solution providers. Their goal is to provide a seamless charging experience on the road while bundling home charging installation with EV sales, and they are structuring partnerships while applying their own branding to the driver's experience.

For example, General Motors is partnering with Pilot Co. and charging network EVgo to build 2,000 branded charging stations. This is on top of the 3,250 charging stations GM was already installing with EVgo. (Full disclosure: EVgo is a client of my company.) Ford uses a ' network of networks ' to deliver its branded public charging service; it was also among the first OEMs to negotiate a deal that allows its drivers to charge using the Tesla network.

Taking a different approach, Mercedes Benz plans to build 400 charging plazas with 2,500 charging plugs across the U.S. And a consortium of seven OEMs, following the pattern set by Ionity in Europe, announced a joint venture to build 30,000 high-speed chargers in North America.

Common Goals, Common Challenges

One result of all this movement is a complex, interconnected network of players across the EV charging ecosystem. Participants at all levels share the goals of monetizing EV charging, accelerating EV adoption by removing charging as an obstacle and delivering a seamless charging experience for private and fleet drivers.

However, they all share the challenges of acquiring adequate electricity supply for every location, managing electricity consumption and costs, and achieving the operational excellence required for high availability and reliability. Suffice it to say, it's complicated, but I believe it's doable. If companies in the sectors described above manage to reach their goals, the real winners will be EV drivers and the climate, as these new purveyors of EV charging can help smooth out the bumpy journey to electrifying transportation and recharging the planet.

Navigating Decarbonization: Lessons For The Oil And Gas Industry,Nastasya Savina,2024-02-07 12:15:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/07/navigating-decarbonization-lessons-for-the-oil-and-gas-industry/,forbes.com,"Three trends, along with a few lessons from climate startups, can steer the oil and gas sector toward climate-friendliness and ease their transition to greener practices.","Bridging the gap between climate innovators, investors, and corporate buyers via 1step2market startup platform and Innovation Zero Awards.

The COP28 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai, held in late 2023, carried the anticipation of a clear road map to reduce the effect of fossil fuels on the climate. As the International Energy Agency (IEA) aptly stated in a pre-COP report, the ""oil and gas industry faces a moment of truth and opportunity to adapt as clean energy transitions advance.""

From my time working at an electric vehicle charging company to now as the CEO of a support platform for climate startups, the topics of climate technologies and decarbonization are very close to my heart. I am currently managing an award project that assists sustainable corporate buyers in identifying the most efficient and purchasable climate-friendly solutions. Based on these experiences, I believe three trends, along with a few lessons from climate startups, can help steer the oil and gas sector toward climate-friendliness and ease their transition to greener practices.

1. Decarbonization

The IEA report said that by 2030, the oil and gas industry's emissions need to decrease by 60% to help reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Innovative technologies are being developed to help reduce carbon emissions in oil and gas sector operations.

For instance, DecarbonX by Angara has the potential to reduce refineries' emissions by up to 15% over the course of a few months and targets up to 40% savings in two or three years, according to Inc. Arabia. (Full disclosure: My company has worked with Angara.) There are many other interesting startups with technologies that aim to reduce the carbon footprint of the oil and gas sector as well. For example, Renewell Energy repurposes existing oil wells and converts them into renewable energy storage systems.

Companies in this space can explore solutions for reducing carbon and methane emissions to both manage the industry's carbon impact and positively affect the bottom line.

2. Implementing CCUS

Carbon capture utilization and storage, known as ""CCUS,"" involves the capture of carbon dioxide and then either using it or transporting the compressed CO2 to either be used in other applications or injected into deep geological formations. There are about 40 commercial carbon capture facilities in operation globally today, with about 65% of carbon capture capacity at natural gas processing plants, ""but new CCUS developments are increasingly targeting other applications,"" according to the IEA.

""The oil and gas sector is well placed to scale up some crucial technologies for clean energy transitions,"" one of which includes carbon capture, the IEA also said. From my perspective, carbon capture could help reduce emissions not only from the industry's operations but also from other sectors down the value chain.

3. Diversifying Away From Fossil Fuels

Climate scientists have said that without an immediate plan to phase out fossil fuels, the average global temperatures will rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would trigger processes in the ecosystem that are irreversible.

However, at the moment, only 1% of investments in clean energy comes from oil and gas companies, and of that 1%, more than half comes from just four companies, the IEA reported. I believe this reluctance to invest in clean energy projects can be explained by the cost of renewable energy projects (paywall). Despite the pressure from the public, the profitability of the traditional oil and gas industry is still high enough that incumbents are not too motivated to diversify and divest.

Some are also concerned that a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels will result in a major global energy poverty crisis, particularly in the most vulnerable regions. Sultan Al Jaber, president of COP28, said, ""Show me the roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socioeconomic development unless you want to take the world back into caves."" I believe this argument is based on the fact that electricity grids aren't yet ready to ensure the stability and security of the clean energy supply. It will take years of intense work and increased investments to ensure energy infrastructure is ready for the requirements of a net-zero energy mix.

Lessons Learned From Climate Startups

From my perspective, oil and gas companies must prepare for an inevitable shift, as the IEA predicted the global demand for fossil fuels will peak by 2030. On the timescale of giant industries, that's practically ""tomorrow,"" so they need to act fast.

Three valuable lessons stand out for oil and gas giants to glean from startups:

1. Adopt a startup mindset.

Faced with increasing uncertainty due to public and regulatory pressures, the traditional oil and gas industry must adapt. Embracing a startup mindset involves taking calculated risks, embracing swift change and maintaining a hunger for innovation. It is also critical to plan consistently for alternative scenarios to ensure survival and success despite the environmental change.

2. Embrace experimentation.

Startups thrive on continuous experimentation to refine their strategies and develop optimal products. Oil and gas organizations can embrace this approach by establishing comprehensive innovation ecosystems. Some are already doing this, but I believe others need to catch up. These ecosystems include innovation hubs promoting piloting new technologies, inventor contests, accelerators for small teams and venture funds for established companies.

3. Pivot when necessary.

Similar to startups, success for large companies often lies on a different path than initially envisioned. Considering the evolving macro context, it might be beneficial for some fossil fuel companies to transform into a different venture, such as a pioneer of renewable energy, a leader in petrochemical production or a champion of new emission-cutting technologies, for example. Embracing a willingness to pivot in response to changing landscapes can position companies for sustained success in the long run.

Forward-thinking strategies for oil and gas companies involve taking immediate actions, such as exploring new technologies. The long-term strategy likely centers on diversification toward cleaner energy sources or cost reduction to ensure business viability in the net-zero future.

Tomatoes grown in the Chinese region have been banned in the U.S. since January 2021 due to concerns they may have been produced with Uyghur forced labor.,Iain Martin,2024-02-06 14:24:33,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2024/02/06/xinjiang-tomatoes-uyghur-forced-labor-amazon-walmart/,forbes.com,Tomatoes grown in the Chinese region have been banned in the U.S. since January 2021 due to concerns they may have been produced with Uyghur forced labor.,"merican shoppers at Amazon, Walmart, Etsy and grocery delivery apps Instacart and Uber Eats may have unwittingly bought canned tomatoes and pastes produced by Uyghur forced laborers in China's far west region of Xinjiang, which are banned by the U.S. government, according to a Forbes review of product listings.

Tomatoes and cotton grown in the region were banned by the U.S. government starting in January 2021, and a new law barring all goods from Xinjiang kicked in from June 2022. The bans are a reaction to mass detention centers in the region, where Human Rights Watch say up to half a million people from the region's mostly Muslim minority group have been detained and forced to labor in farms and factories.

Since the 2022 ban was imposed under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, U.S. officials have seized more than $2.2 billion of goods at American ports they believed were produced by Uyghur forced labor. Despite this, Forbes found examples of canned tomatoes and pastes from Chinese companies with links to Xinjiang on sale with major online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and via online grocery delivery apps Instacart and Uber Eats using data from Israeli startup Ultra Information Solution's digital vetting platform Publican.

'Chinese importers are still able to easily bypass the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act enforcement,' Ultra's cofounder Ram Ben Tzion told Forbes. 'Forced labor products are still widely available in the U.S. market.'

Tomato brands Nina, Gino, and Zehrat Safa, which have been stocked by third-party sellers operating on Amazon, Walmart and Etsy's marketplaces, are produced by the Chinese company Hebei Tomato Industry. The food processor, which is based around 200 miles southwest of China's capital Beijing, states on its website that 'raw materials come from Xinjiang'' and boasts of the region's sunshine and climate. Hebei Tomato did not respond to a comment request by press time.

Amazon spokesperson Jennifer Flag said the company complies with the law and that 'whenever we find or receive proof of forced labor, we take action and remove that product and may suspend privileges to sell.' Some of the product listings of the banned tomatoes were still live as of publication. Etsy declined to comment but the listings identified by Forbes were taken down. Instacart also declined to comment. Uber spokesperson Caspar Nixon said its sellers are prohibited from 'requesting delivery of restricted items as defined under applicable local laws.' Walmart did not respond to a comment request.

'The only reason for this to take place would be cost.'

Bruce Rominger, chairman of the California Tomato Growers Association

Tomatoes harvested in Xinjiang also appear to be slipping into the supply chain of other American food companies and retailers.

Miami, Florida-based food importer Golden Seed accepted two shipments of tomato paste from Hebei Tomato Industry following the U.S. government ban on Xinjiang products, according to U.S. customs records. Golden Seed's tomato products were listed on Instacart. Golden Seed manager Miguel Cordo said via email that it 'always complies with U.S. laws.'

Latino food company Goya Foods' Puerto Rico arm also accepted a shipment of tomato paste in November 2023 from a subsidiary of Xinjiang Chalkis, according to U.S. customs records. This Shenzhen-listed agricultural producer was spunout from the Chinese state-owned Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which is still a major shareholder. XPCC, a sprawling paramilitary organization created in 1954 to develop Xinjiang's economy, was sanctioned by the United States in 2020 for alleged human rights abuses. Neither Xinjiang Chalkis or its California-based subsidiary American Chalkis have been sanctioned.

Goya Foods spokesperson Natalie Maniscalco provided additional documents confirming the shipment, which showed it had been detained by U.S. customs and then released when it was determined it was not ""forced labor product,' she said. American Chalkis did not respond.

The CBP declined to comment.

Human rights groups have alleged that up to one million people from China's Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz minority communities have been detained in 're-education camps' in a move condemned by the U.S. and several other countries as amounting to genocide. China has repeatedly denied human rights abuses but claimed that sprawling high security camps in Xinjiang provide vocational training and were part of its counter-terrorism program.

The Trump and Biden Administrations have taken a series of measures to ramp up pressure on China over its policies in Xinjiang. The Magnitsky Act was used to sanction Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in July 2020, followed by a ban on the import of cotton, tomato and polysilicon products from the region in June 2021.

President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law in December 2021. This act took a harder line than the earlier orders, and Treasury sanctions, by putting the onus on importers to prove that any product from the Xinjiang region had no ties to forced labor. 'If you're a company who is manufacturing in that area, you're going to need to prove that slaves didn't make it. The presumption is on you,"" Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was one of the co-authors of the bill, said in 2021.

American lawmakers from the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party last month called on the Biden Administration to step up its enforcement of the law. The Wall Street Journal reported that the senators and representatives called for a crackdown on the de minimis trade loophole, which allows small packages to skirt customs control, and criminal prosecutions for those profiting from Uyghur forced labor.

'This example of tomato products linked to Uyghur forced labor still finding their way onto shelves in American stores is simply unacceptable and underscores the importance of our committee's efforts to significantly strengthen the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,' Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) said in a statement to Forbes.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that the majority of the goods seized under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act have been electronics and cotton-based clothing and textiles. Agricultural imports like tomatoes represented only 1% of the $2.2 billion Xinjiang-produced goods seized by CBP since 2022, and even before the ban the scale of Chinese tomato imports to the United States were small. The U.S. is a major tomato exporter, though Chinese tomato paste costs around 70% less than California-grown products, according to industry website Tomato News.

'The only reason for this to take place would be cost,' said Bruce Rominger, chairman of the California Tomato Growers Association. 'California has some of the most stringent environmental, food safety, labor laws and wages in the United States with these standards do come costs.'

That goods and materials from Xinjiang are continuing to slip into the United States shouldn't be a surprise. Around 20% of the world's cotton is produced in China, with the vast majority grown in Xinjiang. Reuters reported in September that CBP found traces of Xinjiang cotton on 15% of cotton clothing examined by the agency using isotopic testing between December 2022 and May 2023.

Madagascar should abolish a new law which allows for the chemical
and surgical castration of people convicted of raping minors as it was ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"", rights group Amnesty International has said.
Last month, President Andry Rajoelina proposed the amendments to the penal code - that include chemical and surgical
castration as punishment for individuals found guilty of rape against minors.
These changes have since been agreed by MPs.
In a statement, Tigere
Chagutah, Amnesty's regional director for east and southern
Africa, said:
Quote Message: In Madagascar, rape cases remain under-reported, and perpetrators often go free due to the victims' and their families' fear of retaliation, stigmatisation, and a lack of trust in the judicial system.

A local administrator who was kidnapped by suspected
separatists in Cameroon's conflict-hit North-West region has regained his freedom, the
regional governor has said.
Nicholas Nkongho Manchang and his aides were ambushed on
Tuesday in a village in Ndu, as they headed for the installation ceremony of
another senior administrator.
Governor Adolphe Lele l'Afrique said on Wednesday that the
government official was 'freed' in a 'swift military operation' ordered by President Paul Biya.
But in a video making the rounds on social media, Mr Nkongho
can be heard saying he escaped captivity and trekked for several hours. The
other members of his convoy are still being held captive.
Cameroon's two Anglophone regions, the North-West and South-West, have been mired in conflict since 2017, as fighting continues between government forces and separatists
seeking a breakaway state. 
Kidnapping of government officials and civilians by
separatists is common, with rights groups also faulting Cameroon's security
forces for human rights abuses.

It is not every day you get to chat to a
billionaire. But as the presenter of the Africa Daily podcast I get to speak to some
really amazing people with brilliant minds. 
And so I found myself recently in the gleaming
London offices of Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese-born businessman. 
When he comes into the room he is relaxed and smiling
and introduces himself as a retiree, but when he chats he is funny and feisty
and clearly not taking life easy - and he ends up telling me off sternly when I
suggest that maybe there are times when corruption is not a bad thing, that it
oils wheels and makes things happen. 
No - he is very clear: corruption is
always bad.
And of course I had to ask the question we all want to ask a billionaire: how much cash have you got in your pocket? About £200 ($250) he said - and a credit card.

The corridor to the Angolan port of Lobito has been part-funded by the United States to try to compete with China for access to minerals. 
The colonial-era railway reopened in 2015 after closing during Angola's civil war but traffic has struggled to take off.

Almost 150,000 people have registered for military service in Mozambique so far this year.
They include 96,741 men and 52,481, with the registration process expected to continue until the end of the month. 
Conscription is compulsory in Mozambique for people between the ages of 18 and 35. People previously served for two years in the army, but this has now been increased to five years. 
Those who register are called up for service only if they pass fitness and other tests. 
Many young people do not mind registering. They see the army as a source of employment. They also know that if they do not register they will not be able to study at state universities, as it is a precondition for admission. It is also a precondition for getting jobs in the government or state companies. 
However, some recruits worry that after their training they could be sent to the front lines of the battle against Islamist insurgents in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

The United Nations is appealing for just over $4bn (£3.25bn) to fund humanitarian operations in Sudan and neighbouring countries hosting refugees. 
The UN describes human suffering of epic proportions in Sudan.
More than nine million people have been displaced by fighting between rival military leaders which began last year. 
Ethiopia, Chad and Egypt are struggling to support refugees from Sudan. UN aid agencies say half of the country's population - 25 million people - is in need of assistance. Eighteen million face acute food shortages.

South African telecoms giant Vodacom plans to appeal against a court ruling that it massively increase the 47m rand ($2.5m; £2m) payout it has offered to the inventor of its Please Call Me texting service. 
The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Nkosana Makate after he rejected the offer in his long-running battle with the company for financial compensation for his lucrative idea. 
The court ruled that Vodacom's offer was ""inequitable"". It ordered the company to give Mr Makate between 5% and 7.5% of the total revenue generated by the Please Call Me product over 18 years, plus interest.
The mybroadband.co.za tech site
 reported that the court also ordered Vodacom to use models presented by Mr Mokate's legal team to calculate the amount, meaning that he could be entitled to around 20bn rand. 
In a statement, Vodacom said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the ruling, and it intended to challenge it in the Constitutional Court - the final court of appeal. 
Two decades ago, Mr Makate, a former Vodacom financial manager, came up with the concept that went on to become the company's Please Call Me service, allowing customers to send a free message to another user on the same network requesting to be called back.
He entered into a verbal agreement with the company's then-director of product development and management, Philip Geissler, that he would get a share of the revenue generated by the product, triggering a dispute that remains unresolved.

US rapper Kanye West has excited his fans in Kenya and Nigeria after listing the two countries among the potential concert venues for his new tour. 
A tentative venue list shared on West's Instagram stories shows that the rapper plans to perform at Eko Energy City in Lagos and the Nyayo International Stadium in Nairobi.
West also shared interest in performing at Egypt's Giza Pyramids.
Although the rapper has not made an official announcement, the tour list has fuelled anticipation among fans in the two countries, with some playfully sharing jokes about the concert on social media.

Some fans also joked that the rapper should announce the ticket prices early so they can save.
Fans from countries such as South Africa have complained about being left out from the potential tour, echoing similar past concerns of major Western musicians excluding the continent from their international tour schedules.

At least 14 soldiers have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 500 others have been affected by a cholera outbreak in south-eastern Haut-Katanga Province, the army told local media.
Gen Eddy Kapend, commander of the 22nd military region, Mura military training centre, confirmed the deaths on Tuesday during a meeting with a delegation from the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) office in Lubumbashi.
""As of 72 hours ago, the number of patients receiving treatment had risen to exactly 144. We have recorded 14 deaths and have saved many patients who have returned to their ranks,"" Gen Kapend told the UN-sponsored Radio Okapi website. 
He said that the outbreak was caused by unsanitary conditions at the military camp.
In July 2023, a cholera outbreak in Kalemie, in neighbouring Tanganyika province, left at least ten people dead.

Image caption: Abiy Ahmed says people may have died due to illnesses associated with malnutrition
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has denied that people were dying of hunger in the conflict-hit regions of Tigray and Amhara, which are grappling with a food crisis.
'There are no people dying due to hunger in Ethiopia,' Mr Abiy told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
He, however, said that 'people may have died' due to illnesses associated with malnutrition.
The PM also acknowledged that drought was affecting people in several regions of the country, including Tigray, Amhara and Oromia, but warned that 'we must refrain from politicising this issue"".
Last month, the state-appointed Federal Ombudsman Institute said nearly 400 people had died of hunger in the northern regions of Tigray and Amhara. The institute's head, Endale Haile, told the BBC that the deaths occurred in the past six months.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRC) has blamed the federal and regional governments for not providing enough humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable.
About 20 million people require food assistance in Ethiopia due to conflicts, drought, and flooding, according to the UN.

Ghanaian MP Farouk Aliu Mahama has been blacklisted by the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) for allegedly attacking a journalist.
It's the strongest statement yet by the association to protect journalists in the country following increasing attacks.
Mr Mahama and his entourage reportedly attacked Mohammed Aminu M. Alabira, who works for Accra-based Citi TV, while he was covering a political event involving the MP's New Patriotic Party (NPP) in Yaba, northern Ghana. 
The MP allegedly slapped and kicked the journalist without provocation, while he was covering chaos that erupted during the party's primaries. 
A police officer and election official were also attacked, but were later rescued by military personnel who were called to the scene.
The GJA and three other associations have urged media organisations to deny the MP access to media platforms.
GJA has also given the ruling NPP and the police a 10-day ultimatum to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators. The police say they have commenced investigations into the incident.
Violence against journalists remains pervasive in Ghana and often goes unpunished. 
In 2019, Ahmed Hussein-Suale, an investigative journalist who had collaborated with the BBC, was shot dead near his family home in Accra by unknown gunmen.

Simai Mohamed Said resigned recently citing poor working conditions
Image caption: Simai Mohamed Said resigned recently citing poor working conditions
Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party (CCM) has questioned the former Zanzibar tourism minister, weeks after he resigned amid shortage of alcohol in the islands. 
Simai Mohamed Said appeared before the party's ethics committee on Tuesday but did not disclose why he had been summoned. 
'It is normal to visit the party's office, and I am not the spokesperson of the meetings, you can find the chairperson or the secretary general of the committee to say something,' Mr Said told journalists immediately after the meeting. 
He had resigned as tourism minister two weeks ago, citing ""unfavourable and disruptive working conditions"".
His resignation has been linked to the alcohol shortage facing the Tanzanian archipelago, which threatens the tourism sector of one of Africa's top travel destinations.
Prices of beer have shot up by almost 100% after the supply chain was disrupted by a sudden change of importers.
Before his resignation, Mr Said publicly accused the Zanzibar Liquor Control Board (ZLCB) of mismanaging the liquor industry. 
But Zanzibar's President Hussein Mwinyi accused Mr Said of having a conflict of interest, while he was the minister.
Reports link one of Mr Said's relatives to one alcohol importing company whose licence was not renewed.
The alcohol shortage comes amid soaring tourist arrivals in the semi-autonomous Tanzanian islands.

Zimbabwe's cabinet has supported proposed legislation to end the death penalty, marking a pivotal point in abolishing capital punishment in the southern African country.
Information Minister Jenfan Muswere on Tuesday said that the cabinet's decision was made following countrywide consultations.
Should parliament approve the bill, life imprisonment will serve as the maximum sentence.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has previously criticised capital punishment.
He was sentenced to death in 1965 following accusations that he bombed a train while fighting against white minority rule. 
Mr Mnangagwa's death sentence was, however, commuted after his lawyers argued that he was underage.

"UK's poorest have borne brunt of cost of living crisis, says thinktank",Richard Partington,2024-02-07 00:01:03,full,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/07/uks-poorest-have-borne-brunt-of-cost-of-living-crisis-says-thinktank,theguardian.com,"‘Deep-scarring effects': Living standards for hardest hit won't return to pre-pandemic levels until 2027, report predicts","Britain's poorest households have suffered a £4,500 hit to their finances since the start of the Covid pandemic, according to a report indicating that those on the lowest incomes have borne the brunt of the 
cost of living crisis
.
Highlighting a dramatic fall in living standards since Boris Johnson's election landslide four years ago, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank said soaring costs for energy, food and other basic essentials had hit those most badly off the hardest.
For the poorest half of households in Britain, it said living standards would be as much as 20% lower this year compared with 2019-20, after taking account of inflation, and would not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2027.
The intervention comes after the payment of the government's 
final £299 cost of living support instalment
 for 8 million people on means-tested benefits this week, in the last of three payouts worth £900 in total.
However, NIESR warned the support remained insufficient to overcome the hit to living standards inflicted when the easing of Covid restrictions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove up inflation at the fastest rate in four decades.
The thinktank said living standards for the poorest tenth of families, after adjusting for inflation, remained 18% below 2019-20 levels even after accounting for government support – delivering a financial blow worth £4,500 in today's prices.
'As a proportion of their budget, they spend a lot more on energy, food and housing [than wealthier households], so they took more of the brunt of the shock,' said Adrian Pabst, NIESR's deputy director for public policy.
'There are deep-scarring effects from these cumulative shocks, and that is despite welcome and significant policy intervention,' he added.
NIESR's news comes after Rishi Sunak claimed in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday that the burden on households was '
starting to ease
' after a fall in inflation from more than 10% a year ago to 
4% in December
. Falling inflation does not mean prices are coming down, only that they are rising less quickly.
In its latest quarterly health check on the economy, NIESR forecast that inflation would drop to as low as 1.2% by the spring, which could spur the 
Bank of England
 to cut interest rates from as early as May. Threadneedle Street has a target set by the government to steer inflation towards 2%.
A combination of lower inflation and sustained wage growth should mean British households 'start to feel better off' this year, the thinktank said, forecasting a rise in living standards of about 1.5% on average over the next two years.
However, it warned this masked stark differences between different households and parts of the country.
'With low economic growth and high costs of energy, food and housing, living standards are recovering slowly and not returning to pre-pandemic levels for another three years,' Pabst said.

After more than a decade of wage stagnation for workers, 'you're basically talking about 15-20 years of no real improvement in living standards' since the 2008 financial crisis, he added.
The thinktank, which is Britain's oldest independent research institute, said the priority for the government ahead of the general election would be to boost spending on infrastructure, rather than tax cuts.
Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, said he expected the government to use improvements in the strength of public finances for tax cuts. 'Hopefully, our message has come across that we would not be overly thrilled about that,' he said.
'There is a desperate need for increased public and private investment if higher growth is to be restored.'
A Treasury spokesperson said: 'As this report acknowledges, the UK economy is beginning to turn a corner thanks to the decisive action we've taken to tackle high inflation.
'But we know the job isn't done, which is why we've supported households with £3,700 between 2022 and 2025. Wages have been rising faster than prices for the last five months, millions of low-paid workers will get a record increase through the national living wage from April and the average worker will save £450 this year thanks to our national insurance cut last month.'",Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Environment Agency failed to protect River Wye from chicken waste, court hears",Sandra Laville,2024-02-07 10:14:20,full,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/07/environment-agency-failed-protect-river-wye-pollution-chicken-waste-court,theguardian.com,Campaigners argue in legal challenge that loophole has allowed poultry farmers to pollute river,"Campaigners argue in legal challenge that loophole has allowed poultry farmers to pollute river
The Environment Agency and the UK government failed to protect the River Wye from catastrophic decline by allowing pollution from industrial chicken farming to saturate the land and devastate the protected river, a legal challenge argues.
Campaigners including Feargal Sharkey protested on Wednesday outside the high court in Cardiff where the judicial review brought by the group River Action is being heard. River Action says a loophole in the law is allowing poultry waste from 25 million chickens intensively farmed in the catchment to poison the Wye.
Charles Watson, the founder of River Action, said the loophole meant the river was almost dead. It has been downgraded by Natural England to an unfavourable state as a result of the mixture of pollution from agricultural runoff and the diffuse pollution from land saturated with nitrogen and phosphorus.
'The largest concentration of intensive livestock production in Europe is farmed in the catchment,' said Watson. 'Twenty-five million chickens are produced in this catchment and we argue that the agency has not enforced the law.
'As a result huge quantities of manure have been allowed to be dumped in the Wye, to the extent that this heavily environmentally protected river is almost dead.'
Watson said the farming rules for water state it is an offence for farmers to apply to the land fertilisers or organic manures at a level that exceeds what the land can naturally absorb. But a loophole in the law states farmers must abide by these rules unless it is impractical to do so.
'This was the result of heavy lobbying by the National Farmers Union over the years,' said Watson. 'This huge loophole has had horrendous consequences as manure from this huge concentration of intensive livestock runs off into the Wye.
'The bodies which are supposed to protect this river have wantonly failed to do their job. The interests of food production have totally superseded protecting the environment.'
The judicial review is being held over two days in Cardiff.
River Action said in court documents submitted to the judicial review that it was not disputed that the Wye, one of the most celebrated rivers in the UK, was in ecological crisis.
'In recent years it has been blighted by algal blooms that suck the oxygen out of the water and choke the native water crowfoot, a trailing aquatic plant, that is the foundation and a protected feature of the river's ecosystem,' the campaign group said.
'The algal blooms are agreed to be caused by excess nutrients, nitrogen and especially phosphorus … It is not disputed that by far the largest single contributor to that nutrient overload is agricultural runoff.'
The NFU deputy president, Tom Bradshaw, said: 'The NFU recognises the need to protect the environment; however, we also believe it is important that legislation is interpreted and applied correctly and proportionately by the Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
'The NFU has decided to intervene in the legal challenge being brought by River Action to ensure that our members' interests are represented before the court on this critical issue.'
An Environment Agency spokesperson said: 'Since 2021 we have performed more than 7,000 farm inspections and required farmers to carry out over 11,400 improvement actions, including around the River Wye. These range from improving slurry storage to better management of nutrients. Our inspection regime is supported by the use of technology such as satellite images and drone footage.",einnews.com,60,-1,GB,en,Sandra Laville,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafc2fdeb76ea00d47eb6ee5e6e7a9bb8214bc13/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1349add36ffa2e0860d9e2b1e6ac6d08,False,@guardian,6.8795605,62938c776852d34132b570aee03edad5,"['pollution', 'chicken farming', 'loophole', 'river', 'agricultural runoff']","Campaigners argue that a loophole in the law has allowed pollution from industrial chicken farming to devastate the protected River Wye, leading to a legal challenge.

'People will keep dying': Fentanyl crisis grips Mexico's border cities,Will Grant,2024-02-07 00:12:00,full,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68101263,bbc.co.uk,"More Mexicans are consuming the deadly drug, leading to a spike in overdoses.","Image caption, 
Paramedics in Tijuana say they are seeing increasing numbers of suspected fentanyl overdoses on their nightshift
The scene which greeted Tijuana's paramedics as they entered 'La Perla' bar in the early hours of the morning was grim.
Two men were unconscious - a heavy-set man sprawled on the floor, his friend slumped in a chair - both clinging to life by a thread.
Once more, the city's emergency services had been called out following a suspected fentanyl overdose - increasingly part of every nightshift, says paramedic Gabriel Valladares.
""It's getting worse. We're seeing more and more, and it's always fentanyl,"" he says.
The synthetic opioid is 50 times stronger than heroin and is making the paramedics' job much harder.
""We generally see two or three overdoses a night. But we've had as many as six or seven cases in a single call - probably because they all took the same substance,"" adds Gabriel.
Some in the team quickly began CPR on the two patients while others prepared doses of Narcan, the most effective drug to reverse a fentanyl overdose.
The two men may not have even known they were taking fentanyl. Because the opioid is cheap and easy to produce and transport, Mexican drug cartels have begun to cut it into recreational drugs like cocaine.
Image caption, 
The Mexican president has played down the extent of the fentanyl problem but authorities in Tijuana disagree
The Mexican border city finds itself in the grip of a full-blown drug epidemic. But the country's president, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, has played down the extent of the problem.
""We don't produce fentanyl here. We don't consume fentanyl here,"" he said last year. Following that controversial claim, he has promised to introduce new legislation to Congress to ban the consumption of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.
Those working on Tijuana's frontlines fear that may be too little, too late.
The director of the state's forensic services, Dr César González Vaca, tells me that for over a year his department has tested every dead body that comes into their morgues in two border towns, Mexicali and Tijuana, for fentanyl.
The study has shown that around one-in-four bodies in Mexicali contained fentanyl, he says, and last July, the statistics for Tijuana were as high as one-in-three.
""It seems the closer we are to the border, the more consumption of this drug we see"", explains Dr González Vaca. ""Unfortunately, we can't compare to other states in the Republic as, in Baja California, we're the first state to carry out this study,"" he adds, urging his counterparts around the country to help build a clearer national picture.
Image caption, 
Many dead bodies in Tijuana test positive for fentanyl, says Dr César González Vaca
People working with the living in Tijuana also claim the president has underestimated the scale of the crisis in Mexico.
Prevencasa is a harm reduction centre in the city which provides a needle exchange and medical services to addicts. Its director, Lily Pacheco, randomly selects two used needles and two empty drug vials from their disposal unit.
All four items of drug paraphernalia test positive for fentanyl. The city is awash with it, says Lily.
""Of course fentanyl exists. To suggest otherwise is a lack of recognition of this reality. We have the evidence right here,"" she says, pointing at the testing strips.
""The overdoses we see and all those who've died from fentanyl are part of that evidence too. Ignoring the problem won't solve it. On the contrary, people will keep dying.""
As our interview ends, there is suddenly a much more visceral illustration of the crisis than fentanyl tests on used syringes.
Lily is rushed outside where someone is overdosing on the street. She carries Narcan too, donated by a US charity after her federal funding was cut, and saves the man's life.
He was lucky. But many were not so fortunate.
The fentanyl epidemic has hit the neighbouring US - the world's biggest market for illegal drugs - especially hard. There, an estimated 70,000 people died of overdoses last year.
Elijah Gonzales was one of them.
Just 15 when he accidentally overdosed on a counterfeit Xanax pill from Mexico, he had no idea it was fentanyl-laced. Text messages Elijah's mother, Nellie Morales, found afterwards suggest it was his first time experimenting with drugs.
His body simply couldn't cope.
""I miss him every day,"" says Nellie in her apartment in El Paso, Texas, adorned with pictures of her son. ""He was going to graduate this June. A piece of me died that day that he died.""
Image caption, 
Nellie's son Elijah overdosed on a fentanyl-laced pill in El Paso, Texas on the other side of the Mexico border
Unfortunately, such deaths are common in the US. More than five Texans die every day from fentanyl, say state authorities, and in El Paso County alone, fentanyl was involved in 85% of accidental overdoses like Elijah's.
City police compare the situation to the crack epidemic of the 1980s.
El Paso sits across the border from one of Mexico's most dangerous cities, Ciudad Juárez. When we visited, US customs officers seized 33kg (73lb) of fentanyl in a single day, enough to kill everyone in El Paso twice over.
Arguments over the drug have even seen some Republicans advocate for sending troops into Mexico to fight the cartels. No doubt such debates will feature highly in the US election campaign. In truth though, given how easily it can be transported, it is almost impossible to stem the flow of fentanyl into the US.
In Ciudad Juárez, I meet Kevin - not his real name - a 17-year-old drug smuggler and hitman for La Empresa cartel. He shows me videos of his gang moving the drug through tunnels beneath the US-Mexico border.
""A kilo of fentanyl makes the cartel around $200,000 (£160,000) in the US"", he says, ""I earn about $1,000 (£800) to take it north.""
Image caption, 
Gangs are recruiting children to help them traffic fentanyl
Kevin has been working with the cartel since he was just nine. But he has never seen anything like fentanyl. He predicts it is the future of the illegal drug trade:
""It's the strongest drug I've ever seen, chemically so powerful that people keep demanding more and more. It's going to keep blowing up,"" he says.
I asked him if he felt any remorse over the deaths of US teens like Elijah.
""No, it's all part of a chain"", he shrugs. ""They send guns south, we send fentanyl north. Everyone's responsible for their own acts.""
Back in Tijuana, it took three doses of Narcan, but the paramedics managed to bring one patient back from the brink in the 'La Perla' bar.
For his friend, though, it was too late. He died amid the beer bottles and empty glasses on the barroom floor.
The paramedics' dignified silence is pierced by the awful sound of wailing. His mother has made it to the bar only to be told her son, at 27, is another victim of this most powerful of narcotics, his death a footnote in an election year on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

UK women ‘need to work extra 19 years to retire with same pension pot as men',Rupert Jones,2024-02-07 12:20:11,full,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/07/uk-women-need-to-work-extra-19-years-to-retire-with-same-pension-pot-as-men,theguardian.com,Research suggests a girl would have to start saving at three years old to close gender pension gap,"Women would need to work for an extra 19 years to retire with the same pension savings as men, according to data from the Pensions Policy Institute.

The research found women retiring at 67 – the new UK state pension age from 2026 – will have saved an average of £69,000, compared with £205,000 for men.

The data, published by the PPI and pensions provider Now: Pensions, suggests that under the current system, in order to close the 'gender pension gap' a girl would need to start saving at three years old to retire with the same amount of money as working men.

Career gaps, caring responsibilities, childcare costs and lower earnings all contribute to the disparity.

As automatic enrolment into workplace pensions – where workers are put into a pension scheme into which they and their employer pay – starts at the age of 22, the 19-year gap meant that 'by age three, girls are already falling behind boys in their provision for later life', the researchers claimed.

However, women often live longer than men – on average by about seven years – meaning their retirement pots also need to last longer.

Now: Pensions is calling for the £10,000-a-year earnings threshold for people to be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension to be removed because it excludes many women who hold multiple jobs or work part-time or as freelancers.

The UK state pension age of 66 is set to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. From 2044, it is expected to rise to 68. However, research issued earlier this week suggested it would have to rise to 71 for those born after April 1970.

Separate industry figures issued on Wednesday indicated that the estimated amount of money needed to enjoy a 'moderate' standard of living in retirement had jumped by £8,000 – or 34% – in a year as a result of the cost of living crisis and changes in behaviour.

The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has developed the 'retirement living standards' to show what life in retirement looks like at three different levels – minimum, moderate and comfortable. Last year it said a single person needed about £12,800 a year to meet the minimum threshold but this year the figure has been put at £14,400.

The new threshold for a moderate standard of living in later life is £31,300 for a single person – up from £23,300 a year ago. To meet the comfortable threshold, the new figure is £43,100 a year for one person – up from £37,300.

The pension provider Scottish Widows said securing a guaranteed annual income of £23,300 for life would require a pension pot of about £500,000 – but securing an income of £31,300 would mean amassing a pension pot of more than £750,000.

‘People are dying waiting for a house': how Australia's healthcare system leaves rough sleepers with nowhere to turn,Christopher Knaus,2024-02-07 15:00:16,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/08/people-are-dying-waiting-for-a-house-how-australias-healthcare-system-leaves-rough-sleepers-with-nowhere-to-turn,theguardian.com,Frontline workers warn that the underfunding of specialised care for homeless people and the lack of emergency housing are leading to preventable deaths,"Nigel Pernu knows all too well the damage homelessness wreaks on a person's health.
He slept rough for six months after six heart attacks left him hospitalised long-term in Adelaide, leading to an opioid addiction.
'You're constantly worrying about where you're going to sleep,' he says. 'It puts a strain on your body. It also increases stress levels, cortisol levels, gives you high blood pressure and weakens your immune system as well.
'And if you don't have a mental health condition or addiction before you're homeless, it's no doubt that you will after you've experienced homelessness. People's lives feel like they're falling apart and there's nothing else to do but take substances, that's why people do it.'

The deaths of Australians experiencing homelessness are largely invisible. No government in the country attempts to count or understand what is driving them, putting us at odds with other western nations.
In an attempt to shine a light on this crisis, Guardian Australia has spent 12 months identifying and investigating 627 homelessness deaths.
The investigation involved analysis of more than a decade of non-public death reports to state and territory coroners, a review of inquest findings since 2010, and dozens of interviews with rough sleepers, victims' families, researchers and advocates.
The Guardian has found that, on average, people experiencing homelessness are dying at an average age of 44. That is vastly premature and a life expectancy gap of more than three decades.
It is the first time the life expectancy gap has been measured at a national level and, despite the data's limitations, the finding is broadly in line with studies in Perth and Sydney.
The investigation also found suicide and overdose, known as deaths of despair, are primary drivers of death. Researchers say such deaths are inextricably linked to the despair and hopelessness of homelessness.
The investigation identified a wide range of systemic failings contributing to deaths, including gaps in health and mental healthcare, the critical undersupply of public housing and failures of the justice system.
Thank you for your feedback.
Pernu now uses his experience as a peer worker for cohealth, which runs a healthcare service for rough sleepers and other disadvantaged groups in 
Melbourne
. His job is to build trust, encouraging people experiencing homelessness to open up about their problems so they can be referred to a team of allied health workers.
But specialised services of the kind offered by cohealth are both rare and operating on a fee-for-service funding model that fails to adequately cover the longer, low-volume consults needed in this type of healthcare.

'They are few and far between and they're all struggling like we are to deliver the care the way it needs to be delivered, and to be able to make ends meet,' says cohealth's chief executive, Nicole Bartholomeusz.
Frontline workers are warning that the underfunding of these services and lack of emergency housing for chronically ill rough sleepers are leading to preventable and premature deaths.
People are literally dying waiting for a house
Lisa Wood, health and homelessness expert
Guardian Australia has spent 12 months 
investigating the deaths of homeless Australians
, reviewing coronial findings over 10 years, accessing hidden coronial data, and interviewing dozens of people experiencing homelessness, their advocates, researchers and support services.
The investigation revealed homeless Australians are dying shockingly early, at an average age of 44, according to 627 death reports to the coroner.
The barriers to rough sleepers accessing healthcare include declining bulk billing availability, stigma and distrust of the medical system, an inability to travel for appointments or to store medication, and the difficulty of keeping clothes clean and managing wounds.

Those barriers mean minor illnesses and injuries can go untreated, only caught when an individual presents to an emergency department.
'You're prioritising what is necessary,' Pernu said. 'That stress ... most people eventually do have some minor ailment that becomes chronic or major, they don't have the healthcare to address that.'
A University of Notre Dame Australia professor, Lisa Wood, an expert in health and homelessness, describes trying to manage health conditions while sleeping rough as a 'disaster'.
'People are literally dying waiting for a house,' she says. 'That is untenable.
'Anyone who is homeless deserves rapid housing but certainly what homeless healthcare workers say is that there should be even more prioritised pathways for people who already have chronic health conditions.'
Bartholomeusz says the provision of housing has significant benefits to the health of rough sleepers. That became obvious during the pandemic lockdowns, she says, when state governments housed those experiencing homelessness in hotels.
The health benefits her staff observed were lost when clients were turned back out on to the streets.

Student News: Crippling Rents Forcing 4 In 10 To Consider Quitting Studies,Bethany Garner,2024-02-08 08:12:56,full,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2024/02/08/student-updates/,forbes.com,"8 February: 64% Struggle With Accommodation Costs



Almost two-thirds of UK students (64%) say they're struggling with housing costs, according to researc","8 February: 64% Struggle With Accommodation Costs

Almost two-thirds of UK students (64%) say they're struggling with housing costs, according to research by website Save the Student, writes Bethany Garner.

The report, which surveyed 1,007 UK students between 17 November 2023 and 12 January 2024, found that 61% had borrowed money to cover the cost of their rent. Of these, 36% turned to parents and 13% to friends, while others relied on credit, with 25% covering housing costs by taking a bank loan or overdraft, 8% using a credit card and 3% taking out a payday loan.

A further 45% of students said their studies have suffered as a result of rental costs, while 72% say their health has suffered.

Forty per cent have considered dropping out of their course altogether due to difficulty affording rent.

Kellie McAlonan, chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisers, said: 'Struggling to pay rent is a reality for many students, and it isn't good enough. Core funding packages need to be good enough to support student success, and safe and affordable housing shouldn't be a lucky find.

'The Maintenance Loan in England needs a revamp. Students can't be expected to plug the gap between basic living costs and the student funding they receive, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult for institutions to shoulder the burden of a system that is not working.'

On average, UK students pay £550 in rent each month, but the sum varies significantly by region. London remains the most expensive area to rent as a student, costing £778 per month on average. At the other end of the scale, those studying in Scotland paid £469 each month.

Despite high rental prices, many students reported issues with their rented accommodation. Damp was the most common problem, affecting 37%, followed by a lack of heating or water, which affected 29% of those surveyed. Almost half (45%) think their accommodation is poor value for money.

Tom Allingham, communications director at Save the Student, said: 'The prolonging of the cost of living crisis is largely thanks to below-inflation increases to the Maintenance Loan in England. And, with just a 2.5% increase announced for 2024/25, these real-terms cuts are becoming baked into the system.'

Inflation was 4% in December, according to official figures.According to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, maintenance loan payments underwent a 11% real terms cut between September 2020 and September 2023 (see story below).

25 January: Students Suffer 11% Real-Terms Cut

Maintenance Loan payments are set to rise by 2.5% for students in England from September 2024, the government announced today, writes Bethany Garner.

The loan, designed to cover student living costs such as food and housing, will increase in line with the forecast inflation figure for the 2024/25 academic year.

The government will also contribute an extra £10 million to university hardship funds – earmarked to support students who are struggling financially – in a bid to combat rising living costs.

Despite the upcoming increase to maintenance Loans, however, students in England will continue to be worse-off in real terms due to the high inflation experienced in recent years. The latest inflation figure from the Office for National Statistics shows it running at 4% in December – it reached 11.1% in 2022.

According to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), maintenance loan payments underwent a real terms cut of 11% between September 2020 and September 2023, leaving students worse off by £107 per month.

Tom Allingham, money expert at Save the Student, said: 'The 2024/25 maintenance loan rates are utterly inadequate, and risk condemning students to a never-ending cost of living crisis.

'Although inflation is falling, the real-terms cuts to the loan have not been reversed. Even if this 2.5% increase matches inflation in the next academic year, students from the poorest backgrounds will still be £1,300 per year worse off in real terms.

'We're calling on the Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan, and the wider government to take heed of our petition and increase Maintenance Loans to catch up with inflation.'

Student Awards Agency Scotland (SASS), which oversees student loans in Scotland, is set to increase maintenance loans to £9,400 from September 2024, marking a 34% increase from the £7,000 earmarked for the previous academic year.

SAAS also provides students below a certain household income threshold with non-repayable bursaries, as does its Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts.

Northern Ireland and Wales are yet to announce their 2024/25 loans.

30 September: Cost Issues Influencing Choice Of Institution

Almost nine in ten first-year students (86%) are worrying about their finances amid cost-of-living pressures, according to a poll from Nationwide, writes Bethany Garner.

The study, which surveyed 1,007 students starting university in September 2023, also found that 76% of first-years said living costs were a key consideration when it came to choosing a university. A further 72% had considered living at home to cut costs.

Students' families also appear to be feeling the pinch, with 69% of new students saying the cost-of-living crisis has reduced the amount of financial support their parents or guardians can provide.

However, 56% of students say they expect to receive at least some financial support from a parent or guardian, compared with just 28% who said their family would not be able to support them at all.

To bridge the gap in living expenses, 31% of students said they will rely on part-time work as their primary source of income while at university. Of these, 47% plan to work up to 10 hours per week, while 42% expect 11 to 20 weekly hours.

Tom Riley, director of retail products at Nationwide, said: 'Heading off to university should be a joyous time for students, but our research shows they are making that journey with a significant amount of financial trepidation.

'This is especially prevalent at the moment with the cost-of-living crisis impacting how much parents and guardians can provide.'Despite their financial concerns, 42% of respondents said they had not opened a student current account. These accounts typically offer an interest-free overdraft, and may also come with perks – such as cashback or a free railcard – that could help students manage their budget.

6 September: Loans Failing To Keep Pace With Living Costs

The average student now spends £1,078 a month on essential living expenses, according to the latest National Student Money Survey – equal to a 17% annual inflation rate, writes Bethany Garner.

Save the Student polled 1,786 UK university students between May and August 2023 and found, on average, they must find an extra £154 each month just to cover essential costs.

Rent was the single largest monthly expense, costing on average £439 a month – an increase of £21 year-on-year – while the average cost of groceries rose by £17 to £133 per month.

However, student Maintenance Loans for the 2023/24 academic year have largely failed to keep pace with rising living costs, with students in England seeing an increase of just 2.8%.

In Northern Ireland maximum loans increased by 9.4% for this academic year, and between 11.1% and 17.6% in Scotland, depending on household income. Only in Wales did Maintenance Loans clear the student inflation rate with a 40% increase.

Overall however, the average Maintenance Loan now falls short of living costs by £582 per month, or almost £7,000 per year.

Tom Allingham, communications director at Save the Student, said it was the ‘most troubling set of results ever seen in the National Student Money Survey'.

'Save the Student is calling on the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, to increase the Maintenance Loan to catch up with inflation, and avoid driving thousands more students into financial turmoil.'

Regional differences

London remains the most expensive region to study, with average monthly living costs at £1,211 – an increase of £122 since 2022. Student life is at its least expensive in Northern Ireland where monthly costs average £905.

However, in every region, students spend more than £900 on living expenses each month.

Impact

Faced with soaring costs, 82% of students said they worried about making ends meet and 55% reported a decline in their mental health.

A further 30% found their grades had suffered, while 38% said their relationships were affected.

Source: Save the Student Student Money Survey 2023

Almost a fifth (18%) of survey respondents told Save the Student they had used a food bank – up from 10% in 2022. Meanwhile, almost half of students (42%) admitted they skipped meals to save money.

Financial pressure has led 54% of students to consider dropping out of university altogether.

Finding funds

The majority of students rely on their parents to help make up the shortfall when it comes to living expenses.

According to Save the Student, 53% of students receive financial support from parents – down slightly from the 59% who received this support in 2022 – suggesting some parents may no longer be in a financial position to help.

On average, students receive £227 from their parents per month, which is £77.20 higher than the figure for 2022.

And despite the increase, 15% of students feel their parents' contributions are not enough to cover living costs.

A further 56% of students said they had a part-time job, earning £544 per month on average, while 46% fund their studies with personal savings, 35% use a student overdraft and 26% utilise grants and other funding.

Over a fifth of students (21%) said they have used their university's hardship fund – a 9% increase compared with 2022. Students who used a hardship fund were granted £905 on average.

Kellie McAlonan, chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisors, said: 'The system is broken when our students start their journey needing to address a gap in funding, leading many to stretch themselves with working hours that inevitably impact their student experience.

'The government needs to consider that struggling to fund basic living costs is a reality for many students, and it isn't good enough.'

14 August: Financial Woes Add To A-Level Results Week Stress

More than half of current and prospective students (54%) have considered not going to university because of the financial costs incurred, according to research from the Association of Investment Companies (AIC), writes Bethany Garner.

The study – which gathered responses from 1,000 current and prospective university students, as well as 1,000 parents with children aged 13 to 21 – also found the number of students worried about the cost of university has increased.

In 2022, just 35% of students said they had thought about not going to university because of how much it would cost.

The figures come in the run up to A-Level results day on 17 August.

The AIC study also found that, despite rising living costs, the majority of students (59%) say their parents are able to financially support them. Over half (52%) of parents with children at university said supporting them through their studies was a top financial priority.

Despite their willingness to help, however, 76% of parents said the rising cost of living has made it more difficult to offer this support.

As well as worrying about making ends meet during their studies, university students are also concerned about paying off their debts when they graduate. Just 44% of respondents who have, or plan to have, a student loan believe they will pay it off in full before the debt is cancelled.

Currently, the Student Loans Company (SLC) clears any remaining debt an individual has borrowed 30 to 40 years' after graduation – depending on their plan and when the loan was taken out.

Men were significantly more likely than women to expect to repay their loan in full. Among male students 60% expected to clear their debt entirely, compared with just 33% of their female counterparts.

12 July: London, Bristol See Largest Increases In Costs

University students leaving halls of residence face a jump in rental costs up to just shy of 50% according to a new study, writes Bethany Garner.

The research, conducted by shared living space provider, Gravity Co, compared the cost of an en-suite room in student halls at 10 of England's largest universities with the average cost of a one-bed home in each city's private rental market.

It found that students in Bristol and London face the largest jump in prices when moving from halls of residence to a privately rented home – a common transition for students completing their first year of study.

Renting a one-bed property in Bristol cost £249 per week on average – 49.2% higher than an en-suite room in student halls.

Meanwhile, students in London pay an average of £401 per week for a one-bed flat, compared with £270 per week for an en-suite room in halls. This represents a price increase of 48.4%.

In Sheffield, renting a one-bed home costs 21% more than an en-suite room in halls, on average. In Manchester this discrepancy falls to 12.9%, while in Leicester it's 6.6% and 4.1% in Leeds.

Coventry had the smallest price discrepancy between student halls and private rental homes. The average one-bed property costs £163 per week to rent, while the city's student halls cost £160 per week.

These price differences reflect the growing cost of renting. According to ONS data, the average UK rents rose 5% in the year to May 2023.

However, three cities – Birmingham, Nottingham and Liverpool – were found to have private rental accommodation at a lower price than halls of residence.

In Birmingham, renting a one-bed home costs £163 per week on average – 3.9% lower than an en-suite room in halls. Similarly, an average one-bed home in Nottingham costs £163 per week in rent, while an en-suite room in student halls would cost £169.

Elsewhere, students in Liverpool can expect to pay 22.1% less rent per week, on average, for a one-bed home in the private rental market than they would for an en-suite room in university halls.

Riccardo Tessaro, co-founder and chief executive officer of Gravity Co, commented: 'The jump in living costs will be especially sharp for those in Bristol and London, where university halls can be as much as 50% cheaper than renting privately.

'Escalating costs in the rental sector [also] makes it more challenging than ever for those embarking on their careers, as a higher proportion of their income will be paid out in rent.'

While the study revealed some dramatic price discrepancies between student halls and privately rented homes, the two types of accommodation may not always be equivalent.

Many halls of residence include shared spaces – such as kitchen or laundry facilities – while a one-bed home or studio flat is typically self-contained.

Some students leaving halls behind may be able to save money by grouping together and splitting the cost of renting a home with two or more bedrooms.

12 June: Pre-Term Spending To Climb 54% Year-On-Year

UK students are set to spend a collective £4.5 billion as they prepare to head to campus this Autumn, according to the annual Back to Campus report from UNiDAYS – a student affinity platform.

The average student plans to spend £1,585 – a steep 54% increase compared with 2022, when the figure stood at £1,027.

 line the streets of Ngor, a suburb of Dakar. Beside the occasional passing sheep are telltale signs of wealth—ice cream shops and gyms—that should be enticing to banks offering mortgages. Yet loans are hard to come by. Sam Thianar and his family live in two rooms of the apartment block he is building. The rest he hopes to rent out. Although construction started years ago, the building is a mess of concrete and exposed wires. 'When I save a little money, I buy some sand and cement and build a little more,' he says. He applied for a loan of 10m

The struggle to finance and build homes is contributing to a profound housing crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. In almost all African countries even the very cheapest new home is too expensive for a typical teacher or police officer with the mortgage they could obtain, according to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance (
CAHF
) in Africa, a research outfit in South Africa (see chart). Instead many Africans live in housing without toilets or reliable electricity. Some 230m people, half of all urban dwellers in Africa, live in slums, a number that is rising because of urbanisation and population growth. 
image: The Economist
Yet Africa's need for housing is also a tremendous opportunity. A mind-bending 70% of the buildings expected in Africa in 2040 do not exist, reckons the 
UN
. Building them could be a boon not just for slum-dwellers but for growth, jobs and, potentially, climate-friendly construction. Africa will be the construction site of the world, enthuses Ian Shapiro of Reall, an investor in African housing.
 The main reason for this chronic shortage of housing lies with how homes are built now. Perhaps 90% are self-built, usually incrementally over many years. Cities are thus riddled with unfinished buildings. Some buy their homes from developers, where they pay a portion up front, more during construction and the rest on completion. Yet if developers do not sell enough apartments in the building or hit other troubles, then everything stops. 'It puts the risk on the buyer,' says Seeta Shah of 
FSD
 Kenya, a financial think-tank. 'You could get burned, or you could get your home.'
Both ways of building tie up scarce capital in cement that houses no one and earns nothing for years. And because of the tight finances, truly large-scale housing projects are rare.
Building quality homes in Africa also involves a fiendishly complex set of tasks—from buying land and wrangling title to persuading governments to install water to the area and finding a buyer. Finishing one step often depends on progress in all the others. And each needs financing. 'It's a dance, it's not a straight line,' says Kecia Rust of 
CAHF
.
 The cheapest newly built house generally costs the equivalent of $20,000-40,000. Yet income per person is only about $1,700. The high cost is partly caused by red tape. In Kenya, for example, there are 140 laws, policies and regulations relating to affordable housing. Building codes, which often date back to the colonial era, also set inappropriate standards. In Kenya a car park is required for any two-bedroom home. The result is that those who build formally cannot build cheaply. Many small builders dodge regulations. That makes them cheaper but often more dangerous.
The lack of land titles also hits supply and drives up prices. Developers need this paperwork before they can build; without it they risk losing the entire investment. Yet just 4% of countries in Africa have mapped and registered the private land in their capital cities. On average it costs more than 7% of the value of the property to register it. In parts of Nigeria this cost reaches 20%.
Weak titles also make it harder for people to borrow. This is because banks will generally refuse to lend against a property if the ownership of it is fuzzy. That is one reason why there are vanishingly few mortgages in Africa. Uganda, with almost 50m people, has about 7,000 mortgages outstanding. It is not an extreme case. In most sub-Saharan countries the stock of mortgage debt to 
GDP
 is lower than 1%. By comparison, in Britain it is 65%. A second reason is that perhaps 85% of people have informal jobs, such as selling fruit at the market or riding a motorbike taxi. As such they do not have pay slips that could prove to banks that they can afford to repay a loan. A third is that many Africans need a loan to start building a home, but banks are especially reluctant to lend if the only collateral is undeveloped land.
Bigger financial forces push up mortgage rates and sharply limit the number of loans available, too. A rule of thumb is that mortgage rates need to be in single digits to have a chance of being affordable, says Simon Walley of the World Bank. Yet just 15 out of 48 countries for which there are data in sub-Saharan Africa have rates below 10%. That is firstly because central-bank rates, a floor for mortgages, are persistently high to curb inflation. Compounding the problem is the scarcity of long-term finance in Africa and the fact that governments grab most of it. Banks and investors can earn 13-15% a year simply by buying government bonds. Setting up a retail banking business, finding customers, trying to measure the credit risk of people with no pay slips and fuzzy collateral involves an awful lot of effort —and risk—in comparison.
There have been efforts in recent years to make mortgages cheaper, often by setting up mortgage-refinance companies. These are usually owned by clubs of banks, backed by governments and get cheap loans and equity from development-finance institutions (
DFI
s), such as the World Bank. This allows them to borrow more cheaply in capital markets than banks can. The refinance companies then pass on their lower borrowing rates to banks to achieve cheaper mortgages. Eight countries in west Africa jointly have such a firm while Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria each have one. These have helped, but nowhere near enough.
In Tanzania, which has a population of 67m, the mortgage-refinance company directly backs only 1,500 outstanding mortgages. In Kenya, with a population of 56m, the mortgage-refinance company has backed just 2,876 loans in almost five years, less than a tenth of its target. Mr Walley of the World Bank, which has lent to most of these companies, says the problem is that 'the housing supply response hasn't happened, or not to the scale we would have liked'. High underlying interest rates also limit their impact, says Aliou Maïga of the International Finance Corporation (
IFC
), the private-sector arm of the World Bank. He also points to a tougher problem: poverty. 'Whatever you do, it's very very difficult to fit income levels into the housing equation,' he says.
All this is prompting a radical rethink. Mr Walley thinks mortgages in Africa can reach a wider scale some day, but says that currently, at best, they are going to serve the richest 5-15% of the population. Mr Maïga is blunter: 'Acquisition by individuals and the mortgage, to me, are not necessarily the right instrument in Africa.' That is striking, given that the 
IFC
 partly owns and finances the mortgage-refinance companies in west Africa, Tanzania and Kenya. The 
IFC 
is now resetting its housing strategy altogether.
If mortgages modelled on the rich world are not right for Africa, what is? One answer is to embrace the reality that African houses are often self-built in stages. Banks are starting to offer smaller shorter-term loans to enable families to, for example, build an extra room to rent out. Housing Finance Bank (
HFB
) in Uganda does just this. Its loans are typically for three years and average about $4,000. The bank requires some collateral, but dodges the headaches of formal title by accepting sales agreements for land or even just belongings like a motorbike or fridge along with a guarantor. 'The performance of these loans is good,' says Michael Mugabi, 
HFB
's managing director. 'They don't default.' Because the loan allows an extension to be completed without delay, it is an efficient use of capital.
Tinker, tailor
Such loans still require clever ways of assessing the creditworthiness of informal workers. Syntellect, an Indian startup, is trying to help with machine learning. An algorithm is fed the results of a questionnaire tailored to the borrower's trade—from street-food vendor to tailor—and also uses utility payments, mobile money records and geolocation intelligence about whether, say, a street vendor has wealthy potential clientele nearby. It recently signed up with Kenya's largest microfinance organisation to help with credit decisions for housing loans.
Others see more hope in bigger developers because they may solve the problem of bank loans for new builds. Unity Homes, a developer in Kenya and Nigeria, uses the value of its undeveloped land to provide mortgage banks with financial guarantees that it will complete construction projects. This gives the banks the security they need to lend to customers buying homes before they are completed. 
Still, mortgages are out of reach for people who are not in formal employment. To help them, some 
DFI
s and private firms are experimenting with rental and rent-to-own models. Housing needs to be approached like big infrastructure projects, says Mr Maïga of 
IFC
. By that he means very large developments built by private firms where governments, institutional investors and 
DFI
s guarantee to buy the homes. Families then rent or rent-to-buy from these institutional owners. Rent-to-buy removes the need for an upfront deposit. Instead renters slowly accumulate ownership over time. The 
IFC
 has recently agreed to pilot programmes in this style with three governments in west Africa.
Private developers are also turning to rentals. After more than a decade as a developer of large housing projects in Africa for sale to families, Daniel Font came to a worrying conclusion: 'In some ways we were completely wrong.' Most people had no access to mortgages and those who did buy their units rented them out anyway, he explains. Mr Font now leads a new company, 
SIV
 Africa, which is building homes in Africa to rent. The company plans to own, maintain and operate the projects over a long term while also selling a share of the portfolio on capital markets. The goal is to build quality homes to rent for people who have no access to banks. 'That is 90% of the population in Africa,' says Mr Font.
For the hundreds of millions of Africans with no chance of getting a mortgage who live in cramped, poorly lit, and often unsanitary homes, the rethink cannot happen fast enough.

Francis Schlachter fell from the top of the skip while working
A fruit and vegetable firm has been fined £320,000 over the death of a worker. 
Francis Schlachter, 64, of Southport, died after he fell from a skip at the Burscough farm run by M. A. Forshaw Ltd on 3 January 2020.
M A Forshaw Ltd, of Scarisbrick, West Lancashire, admitted health and safety breaches at Wirral Magistrates' Court. 
Mr Schlachter's wife said he was her ""rock"" and ""always put his family first"".
Mr Schlachter, who was known as Frank, was tipping waste food into a skip from a container on a forklift truck. 
The container could not be properly fixed to the truck and had been known to become loose from the vehicle. 
As Mr Schlachter was standing on top of the skip trying to help fix it to the forklift truck the container slipped and he fell to the ground. 
A Health and Safety Executive () investigation found M A Forshaw Ltd had not fully assessed the risks of the daily task. 
The investigators said the firm would have seen the dangers if it had carried out the right checks. 
The company, of Heatons Bridge Farm, Scarisbrick, West Lancashire, failed to maintain equipment properly or make sure staff knew how to work safely, the  added.
M A Forshaw Ltd pleaded guilty to breaching Regulation 2(1) of the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 and was fined £320,000. 
It must also pay £4,574 in costs.
Mr Schlachter's wife of 35 years, Linda, said she had lost her ""soulmate"". 
""He was a gentleman through and through, who will live on in our hearts and memories forever.
""No man should go to work and never return home after a day of hard work,"" she added. 
 inspector Lianne Farrington said Mr Schlachter's death was an avoidable tragedy. 
""If suitable work practices had been in place... Frank's death could have been prevented,"" she said.

The Northern Ireland Executive should set up a scheme to pay compensation to women injured by pelvic mesh implants, a campaigner has said.
Mary McLaughlin, from Mesh Ireland, was in London to hear England's patient safety commissioner recommend women there 
be given urgent financial help
.
She told BBC News NI she is among thousands who had been left injured after having a mesh implant fitted. 
Ms McLaughlin added many had lost jobs, homes and marriages.
A Department of Health spokesperson said it was aware of the ongoing work of the Patient Safety Commissioner for England.
It added the department will ""take time to consider its report and findings in due course, including in relation to financial and non-financial redress"".

The net-like implant can erode and harden, cutting through tissue and causing serious pain
For years, pelvic mesh was considered to be the gold standard treatment for incontinence and prolapse in women.
However, the net-like implant can erode and harden, cutting through tissue and causing serious pain.
Thousands of women who have experienced life-changing complications have lost their mobility, relationships and jobs.
In 2018, 
a specially-accredited unit was set up in Northern Ireland 
to deal with women who are coping with problems resulting from vaginal mesh implants.
""The women are hopeless, I have women who are suicidal on the phone to me, they are looking for a glimmer of hope,"" Ms McLaughlin. 
""We are hoping the Executive will take on board the report and Northern Ireland will start setting up its scheme for our people to be compensated and looked after.""
Ms McLaughlin added she hoped the recommendations in England represented a ""breakthrough"".
""It is time the government steps up and takes responsibility, they brought theses implants into our system, they have destroyed our bodies, the women have to live with that,"" she said.
""Just because the women are getting into their 50s and 60s and 70s , we shouldn't be discriminated against because we are going to die soon.""

Outback Wrangler star Matt Wright faces fresh charges over fatal Northern Territory helicopter crash,ter,2024-02-08 07:50:15,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/08/matt-wright-helibrook-nt-helicopter-crash-charges-chris-wilson-death,theguardian.com,Northern Territory's WorkSafe has charged the celebrity croc-wrangler and his aviation company Helibrook with ‘reckless conduct for operating unsafe aircraft',"Outback Wrangler star Matt Wright and his aviation company have been hit with a slew of new charges over a fatal chopper crash that killed his co-star.

Chris Wilson plunged to his death in a remote area of the Northern Territory in February 2022 while attached to a helicopter owned by Wright and being flown by pilot Sebastian Robinson.

Robinson survived but was critically injured in the crash.

The NT's workplace safety watchdog charged the celebrity croc-wrangler and his aviation company Helibrook with 'reckless conduct for operating unsafe aircraft' on Thursday.

The watchdog said while a police investigation is yet to determine the cause of the crash, it found 'sufficient evidence' that Wright made up the number of flight hours his aircraft had done, and put his passengers and pilots at risk.

'He engaged in conduct intended to falsify the actual number of flight hours accrued by the aircraft in the Helibrook fleet over an extended period of time,' NT WorkSafe said in a statement.

'This … impacted the regular inspection and replacement of the aircraft's life-limited components … therefore placing at risk the health and safety of the pilots and passengers.'

Helibrook Pty Ltd and Wright have each been charged with two counts of reckless conduct.

A Better Way Of Humanizing Organizations: Psychological Safety And Trust,Csaba Toth,2024-02-07 12:15:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2024/02/07/a-better-way-of-humanizing-organizations-psychological-safety-and-trust/,forbes.com,"If we cannot connect our message to somebody's highest values and needs, it is going to get lost.","Founder of ICQ Global, global experts in measuring and optimising psychological safety, motivational drive and cognitive diversity.

How motivated would you be to pay someone a large sum of money to tell you that you need to lose weight, you are not pretty, your health is not optimal and you need to invest a lot of energy and time into making changes that would ultimately benefit you?

The theoretical answer might be, ""Yes, of course I would do it; that is the right thing to do."" In reality, usually, the answer is a no because it does not feel good and if you do not see the results immediately then even the minimal, initial motivation topped up with some social and cultural pressure would wane away.

That is the general state of the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) field nowadays.

The concept itself is great; it is very much needed. However, the execution of it may have resulted in an outcome that did more harm than good. Elon Musk's tweet 'The point was to end discrimination, not replace it with different discrimination' resonated with many people and outraged many others. The goal is not to choose sides but to understand what may have gone wrong and how it could be fixed. However someone feels about this topic, that is their reality; it will determine how much and what they are going to do about it.

What if we turned that initial question around a bit and you were asked if you are willing to invest and be uncomfortable for a while so you could make more money, which is pretty much guaranteed, according to evidence-based research?

That is more exciting. At the end of the day, money is the language of most companies. If we cannot show them the return on any investment, social pressure-driven marketing activities can survive for a while, but not for long.

That is the main reason I have intentionally moved away from the DEI topic and instead talked about growth, high-performing teams, psychological safety and motivation, as well as measurable and transparent results through data-driven, up-to-date solutions.

If we cannot connect our message to somebody's highest values and needs, it is going to get lost. Having said that, this is not about discrediting or discounting any DEI efforts but approaching it from a different angle to get better results.

When doing the right thing is profitable and it can save lives, it is a no-brainer to do it. As Jacob Morgan's research about future-proofing organizations has made clear, the goal is to humanize organizations. Technology is just one of the nine essential skills and mindsets Morgan has identified; the other eight are directly linked to how much people understand themselves and others.

As long as a company employs and serves people, there is no shortcut: their success depends on their people skills. And this is not industry-specific; most of these lessons can benefit any type of business.

The concept of psychological safety was made well-known by Amy Edmondson. As she did her research in hospitals, it makes sense to share the latest insights from a similar field by Alexandre Messager, author of ABCs of Medical Leadership: Leading with Humanity.

Messager works for uOttawa's faculty of medicine; he has spent over a decade enhancing the leadership skills of healthcare professionals across North America and Europe.

A key observation from Messager's interactions with over 400 healthcare professionals is their struggle with genuine teamwork. This isn't about mere co-location but about fostering mutual respect, trust and empathy. Clinicians, despite years of working together, often remain disconnected from their colleagues, feeling unseen and undervalued. (Now you can see why this is not an industry-specific challenge; it can affect anyone who has to work with other employees, clients or even themselves.)

Clinicians are conditioned for excellence and precision, but this creates an environment where mistakes are viewed as weaknesses. This perception hampers the formation of effective teams and contributes to burnout due to increased workloads and resource constraints. According to Edmondson, it's the belief in non-punitive responses to speaking up that fosters a safe environment.

Messager's preliminary research reveals stark contrasts: female clinicians feel 5% less vulnerable than their male counterparts and 11% less autonomous. The gap widens when comparing clinical leaders to non-leaders: leaders feel 15% psychologically safer and are 9% more motivated, mainly due to clearer purpose and autonomy.

The hierarchical nature of healthcare often deters staff from challenging ideas, fearing negative perceptions. Consider a junior clinician noticing a medication error by a senior; past experiences of reprimand may discourage them from speaking up.

Drawing from his hospitality background, he knows that ""if you want to provide exceptional service to guests, you have to first take care of your employees."" He notes that it's imperative to value every member, from clinicians to medical students, making them feel seen and heard. Addressing the myth of perfection is vital for fostering psychological safety. Without it, healthcare worker burnout and patient safety risks escalate.

Similarly, organizations of all kinds must prioritize their people—and their psychological safety—first. It's time for a change and the need to humanize organizations. Putting up more posters on the walls and posting more about the importance of the topic won't make it happen, but these actions can dramatically accelerate progress:

• Invest in up-to-date, data-driven solutions to measure and optimize those invisible forces that make or break a team.



• The easiest way to increase psychological safety is by not ruining it in spite of our best intentions and common sense. Make the process as uncomplicated and practical as possible.

When you create a psychologically safe and motivating environment, it directly contributes to your bottom line while also helping you achieve high levels of DEI as a result of that. It is a win-win.

"Brisbane hit with $20,000 fine for concussion protocol breach in AFLW grand final",Jack Snape,2024-02-07 07:34:09,full,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/07/aflw-grand-final-sophie-conway-brisbane-lions-concussion-protocol-breach-fine,theguardian.com,The Lions failed to act when informed of an incident involving Sophie Conway with the AFL imposing a sanction even though midfielder was not concussed,"Brisbane Lions have been penalised $20,000 for allowing a key midfielder to play five minutes at a crucial time of last year's AFLW grand final in breach of concussion guidelines.

The AFL imposed the monetary sanction – half of which is suspended – even though an investigation into the incident found the breach 'non-deliberate', and that the player in question, Sophie Conway, was not concussed.

An AFL statement described the breach as 'at the lower end of the scale', but reiterated the need to follow concussion guidelines.

'The AFL is committed to protecting the health and safety of all players and requires strict compliance with concussion guidelines from our Clubs,' AFL general counsel, Stephen Meade, said.

'Whilst we acknowledge that Brisbane's breach was not deliberate, and Conway did not in fact suffer a concussion, we set high standards that must be met in the assessment of head trauma to avoid the risk of further injury.'

Conway was seen to stumble late in the third-quarter of the grand final in December by the dedicated concussion medical spotter, who notified Brisbane.

The Lions' doctor didn't immediately see the message from the medical spotter, which would have required the player to be taken from the field and assessed for a concussion.

At around the time of the stumble, North Melbourne wrestled the lead from the Lions and the match hung in the balance.

The Brisbane doctor was alerted to the message at the start of the three-quarter time break and briefly assessed Conway, but allowed her to return to the field without undergoing a formal SCAT5 concussion test as required.

Conway was finally removed from the field after Dakota Davidson kicked a goal to reduce the margin to one point – approximately 10 minutes of time, and five minutes of match play – after the initial message.

Brisbane went on to kick three more goals to win the match by 17 points to clinch the premiership.

Conway, after passing the concussion test, was allowed to return for the final stages of the match.

The Lions issued a statement saying 'player safety remains our highest priority at all times'.

'We accept the AFL's decision, noting this was a non-deliberate breach of protocols and Conway did not suffer a concussion in the incident.'

The $10,000 of the fine that is payable now will be included in the club's AFLW soft cap, while the suspended portion will only be payable if there is a similar breach in Brisbane's AFL or AFLW program in 2024.

The sanction comes as the sport faces risk of liability for its management of concussions.

AFL's general manager of football, Laura Kane, said on Tuesday player safety was a priority.

'We have six people here that are employed to work on concussion, we have doctors, we have doctors at all of our clubs and we will continue to be guided by the advice of those experts.'

"‘Culture of fear' at Sussex hospitals trust, Royal College of Surgeons reports",Matthew Weaver,2024-02-06 16:29:02,full,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/06/culture-of-fear-at-sussex-hospitals-trust-royal-college-of-surgeons-reports,theguardian.com,Review suggests replacing executives at body running Royal Sussex in Brighton and Princess Royal in Haywards Heath,"Bosses at hospitals where police are investigating dozens of deaths have been criticised for 'bullying' and fostering a 'culture of fear' among staff in a damning review by the Royal College of Surgeons.
The review focused on concerns about patient safety and dysfunctional working practices in the general surgery departments at the Royal Sussex County hospital in 
Brighton
 and the Princess Royal hospital in nearby Haywards Heath.
But the reviewers were so alarmed by reports of harassment, intimidation and mistreatment of whistleblowers that they suggested executives at the University 
Hospitals
 Sussex trust may have to be replaced.
They concluded: 'Consideration should be given to the suitability, professionalism and effectiveness of the current executive leadership team, given the concerning reports of bullying.'
The report comes as Sussex police continue to 
investigate allegations of medical negligence and cover-up
 in the general surgery department and neurosurgery department, involving more than 100 patients, including at least 40 deaths, from 2015 to 2021.
The investigation was prompted by concerns from a general surgeon, Krishna Singh, and a neurosurgeon, Mansoor Foroughi, who lost their jobs at the trust after blowing the whistle over patient safety.
The findings of the review, which was conducted last year and published in the trust's board papers, suggest problems at the hospital have continued beyond the timeframe of the investigation. They will increase whistleblowers' concerns that treatment at the trust remains unsafe.
The reviewers were 'particularly concerned' about the 'culture of fear … amongst staff when it came to the executive leadership team'. They added: 'There were concerning reports of bullying by members of the executive leadership team, with instances of confrontational meetings with individual consultant surgeons, when they were told to ‘sit down, shut up and listen'.'
The review found staff felt 'intimidated' and reluctant to raise concerns for fear of reprisals. It recommended support for whistleblowers 'so that they feel psychologically safe in raising concerns'.
'Staff reported being reluctant to put any concerns in writing, as they would then worry about being victimised, referred for regulatory action and/or dismissed, as they believed this had happened to colleagues,' the review said.
'This ‘culture of fear' was said by some to exist in association with a number of chief executives, with their ‘tactic' being to reportedly pick on someone in the department who spoke up and then to dismiss them.'
The current chief executive, George Findlay, and his predecessor, Marianne Griffiths, who retired in 2022, were praised by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt for building 'the best learning culture I saw anywhere in the NHS'.
The review heard reports of bullying in the surgery department, including where two trainees were 'physically assaulted by a consultant surgeon in theatre during surgery'. It called on the trust to 'address fractured relationships within the department in order to restore unity'.
The report raised a series of concerns about patient wellbeing, including high cancellation rates and long waiting times that could be dangerous.
It found cancellations often happened on the day of surgery 'after patients had been waiting for up to seven hours, having prepared for surgery, for example, by not eating and/or drinking'.
Emergency admission for colorectal cancer patients was running at 54%, far above the national average of 20%. Mortality rates for abdominal surgery were also higher than the national average, posing a 'threat to patient safety'.
The reviewers were alarmed by a high volume of complaints from patients, with 45 open complaints at the time of the review. But it noted improvements in the way the trust was learning from past errors and found staff were 'extremely engaged, open and helpful'.
The trust has been approached for comment. 
Speaking to the BBC South East
, Findlay said the report was 'a really tough read'.
But he said the trust had 'really worked hard' to make sure staff could raise concerns. He added: 'We now need to look to the future and continue to make improvements to make it better for our staff, better for our patients.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Matthew Weaver,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d9fd217d952fa89cba7ce72ae7e28d2605f981/0_107_5776_3464/master/5776.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5251fd7e81f6e69415557a3b0f8a569,False,@guardian,7.581851,bf8dcd883ed034df15fc164cb2c0eb14,"['bullying', 'patient safety', 'whistleblowers', 'medical negligence', 'culture of fear']",A review by the Royal College of Surgeons criticizes hospital bosses for fostering a 'culture of fear' and 'bullying' among staff at the Royal Sussex County hospital and the Princess Royal hospital.

A crew member working on the upcoming Marvel TV series Wonder Man has died on set after falling from high rafters. 
The incident took place at the Radford Studio Centre in Los Angeles. Filming was not occurring at the time. 
The man, who was working as a rigger - someone who sets up scaffolding on film and TV sets - later died of his injuries. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation into what happened. 
""Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends, and our support is behind the investigation into the circumstances of this accident,"" a Marvel spokesperson said in a statement.
The man has not yet been named. 
Filming of Wonder Man, which stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Ben Kingsley, was due to restart in March after being delayed by the recent Hollywood strikes.
The Disney+ series focuses on Simon Williams, who joins the world of superheroes after being gifted with supernatural powers. 
While deaths and serious injuries on film and TV sets are considered to be relatively rare, there have been a number of high-profile incidents in recent years.
Actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
Last year, several crew members on the set of the Gladiator sequel in Morocco were

Primodos victims 'airbrushed' from financial help,Sophie Hutchinson,2024-02-07 18:44:32,full,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68231816,bbc.co.uk,Families are heartbroken to be left out of a scheme proposing support for other patients.,"Image caption, 
Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos and believes her daughter's physical disabilities are linked to the drug
Families who say their children were harmed by a hormonal pregnancy test feel they have been ""airbrushed"" from a scheme proposing financial help.
Primodos was given to more than a million women in the UK in the 1960s and 70s.
The scheme by the Patient Safety Commissioner recommends urgent monetary support for patients damaged by an epilepsy drug and pelvic mesh implants.
The Commissioner is urging ministers to support Primodos families.
Women were prescribed two Primodos pills to detect if they were pregnant. If there was no pregnancy, it would trigger a period.
The tests were withdrawn from the market in 1978 and families have argued for decades that it was responsible for birth defects, miscarriages and stillbirths.
The manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, has always denied a link and last year a Court judge ruled there was 
no new evidence linking the tests with foetal harm
. 
In 2020, the 
First Do No Harm review
 of Primodos, pelvic mesh implants and the anti-epilepsy drug sodium valproate, found avoidable harm had been caused by failures in the healthcare and regulatory system affecting tens of thousands of lives.
This led to a government apology and the appointment of England's first Patient Safety Commissioner, who is tasked with giving patients a voice.
Image caption, 
The ingredients in Primodos
However, the first major report by the Commissioner, Dr Henrietta Hughes, has only looked into financial redress for those damaged by pelvic mesh implants and sodium valproate, which she says 
should be provided by the government urgently
.
The report states the terms of reference did not include the issue of hormone pregnancy tests and that this was a decision taken by the Department of Health. 
Marie Lyon gave birth to a daughter with limbs that were not fully formed, after being prescribed Primodos. She has been campaigning for nearly 50 years. 
""The fact that we were excluded from this report is devastating, because it's as if the families don't matter,"" she says. ""The Primodos families have been airbrushed.""
""Mums like me all feel guilty, we took those tablets and our children were damaged, or they died.
Image caption, 
Marie Lyon holding her daughter Sarah at four months old
""At the moment we're looking after the physical and mental needs on our own. We don't get anything from the state. There's no help.""
Dr Hughes says she hopes her recommendations will act as a blueprint for redress for any harmed group of patients: ""There are so many examples where the views and voices of patients aren't immediately listened to and acted upon.
""I hope that the government will be able to use the information in the report to identify those who have been harmed and then look for ways of supporting them, and that would include Primodos families.""
The Commissioner's ten recommendations are now being considered by governments across the UK.

On the day of the incident, he was working with a colleague in the yard moving a large granite slab into the workshop.

The inquest heard the slab had moved towards him, clipping the A-frame of another nearby piece of granite which also fell in a âbrief domino effectâ, leaving Mr Harvey trapped between the two slabs.

Mr Harvey could not have reasonably been expected to be able to hold the weight of the slab which had tipped towards him, the hearing was told.

The inquest heard an industry bulletin covering the moving of heavy objects had stipulated that no employee should be in the hazard zone during the handling of the slabs, which is where Mr Harvey had been standing when it fell.

Coroner James Brooks said he was satisfied that if Mrs Glassey had been aware of that bulletin it would have been added to the risk assessment for the work.

The inquest heard Mrs Glassey was in charge of health and safety at the firms but did not have any formal qualifications, however she had enlisted the assistance of a consultancy firm on that front.

The hearing also heard that the weight of the slab being handled on the day of the incident would have required more than two workers, but since neither was experienced in moving such large items âthe system of work utterly fell apartâ.

However, Mr Brooks said both men were âentitled to believe what they set out to do was entirely good and properâ.

But he said he did not find any intent by the employers to create an unsafe environment for staff working at the site.

The inquest heard Mr Harvey's injuries were so severe they had been âunsurvivableâ.

More than 100,000 woman are believed to have had mesh implants installed between 2007-2015 - many unaware of the risks
Families of children left disabled by an epilepsy drug and women injured by pelvic mesh implants should be given urgent financial help, England's patient safety commissioner has said.
Dr Henrietta Hughes has called on the government to act quickly to help victims of the two health scandals. 
It follows a review
 which found lives had been ruined because concerns about some treatments were not listened to.
Ministers say they will consider and respond to the recommendations.
It is estimated that, since the early 1970s, about 20,000 babies have been born with disabilities after foetal exposure to sodium valproate, which can harm unborn babies if taken in pregnancy. 
Scientific papers from as early as the 1980s suggested valproate medicines were dangerous to developing babies, yet warnings about the potential effects were not added to some packaging until 2016.
Some families affected have been campaigning for decades to raise awareness of the potential effects of the drug, with some calling for 
compensation and a public inquiry.
Dr Hughes was asked by the government to look into a potential compensation scheme for those affected by that scandal, as well as the one involving some 10,000 women who were injured by their 
pelvic mesh implants 
- a treatment for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and incontinence.
Some women were left in permanent pain, unable to walk, work or have sex. 
Figures suggest there were 127,000 mesh implants to treat incontinence and POP between April 2008 and March 2017, but campaigners believe the actual number is higher.
Dr Hughes has recommended initial payments of £100,000 to be made to victims of the sodium valproate scandal and £20,000 to be paid to women injured by mesh implants.
This should be followed by further payments for some, as well as some non-financial assistance to victims and their families, Dr Hughes said.
Dr Henrietta Hughes told the BBC she believed the sodium valproate scandal was ""bigger than thalidomide"" - referring to the severe birth defects caused by a morning-sickness drug, which was licensed in the 1950s in the UK.
""I've heard so many heartbreaking stories about the problems they're having in terms of getting access to the medical care that they need, but also the impact that it's had on the parents who have had to give up their work, give up their businesses and stay at home and care for their children,"" Dr Hughes said.
She said many of those born with disabilities - known as foetal valproate syndrome - had been unable to work or look after themselves as adults.
She said a redress scheme was ""a question of justice"" for families who had ""been fighting for years or even decades"".
Failure to help victims of the scandal would show ""a callous disregard for the pain and the suffering"" of those harmed, Dr Hughes said.
Image caption, 
Emma Friedmann told the BBC she feels ""guilt"" after her son Andy was born with foetal valproate syndrome
Emma Friedmann, whose son Andy was born with foetal valproate syndrome, said she felt guilty about her son's condition.
""It's the guilt of taking the pills. It's the guilt of not asking enough questions. It's the guilt of becoming pregnant. It's the guilt of believing your doctors… It's the guilt of not being able to provide for your family.""
Andy, now aged 25, is unlikely ever to live independently and is more like a six-year-old, his mother said. 
Mr Friedman said she was not hopeful she would receive any compensation and that her trust ""can never be fixed"".
""This is what makes me upset - that these people have known for so long and they are still resisting... doing things.""
She said she had found it difficult to cope emotionally, at times. 
The government now says the drug should not be given to women or girls of childbearing age, except in special circumstances. 
Even now, about three babies a month are born with developmental disorders and physical abnormalities after foetal exposure to the drug.

Sadie Lambourne said her life turned into a ""nightmare"" after having a pelvic mesh implanted
A review in 2020 concluded that the suffering caused by pelvic mesh had also been entirely avoidable, caused by failings in the health system and a failure to heed families' warnings.
Dr Hughes told the BBC many women who have been injured by the mesh have suffered, need wheelchairs and have to ""pay a fortune"" to travel to hospital appointments. 
""It just adds insult to injury,"" she said.
Sadie Lambourne, from Yeovil, told the BBC she had lost her independence due to injuries sustained by her mesh implant.
She said she was advised by a surgeon to have it fitted to treat incontinence. After a few years, she said she began to suffer severe pain in her lower back and had many infections.
""The mesh had eroded through into my bladder, causing all the infection and pain,"" she explained.
Sadie had to give up working because she could not stand or sit for long periods, and her teenage children now help her shower and get into bed.
""I'm not able to be a mum for them,"" she said. 
""We are living hand-to-mouth and we don't go on holiday.
""A redress scheme would mean I don't need to worry.
""If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have had the mesh.""
Women's Health Minister Maria Caulfield said: ""Our sympathies remain with those affected by sodium valproate and pelvic mesh and we are focused on improving how the system listens to patients and healthcare professionals, as well as introducing measures to make medicines and devices safer.""

"Nine states, including California and New York, sign heat pump agreement to clean up air pollution",Justine Calma,2024-02-07 10:00:00,full,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24063751/heat-pump-mou-nine-states-california-new-york,theverge.com,"'Heat pumps are really, really gaining momentum.'","Nine states inked an agreement today to promote heat pump sales. The memorandum of understanding (MOU) sets a 2030 target for heat pumps to make up 65 of residential heating, cooling, and water heating equipment sales. By 2040, the goal is for heat pumps to account for 90 percent of the HVAC and water heating market. 
Heat pumps are 
more energy efficient alternatives
 to traditional heating 
and
 cooling systems. And because they're electric, they can feasibly run on renewables like wind and solar once there's more clean energy coursing through power grids. The states on board with the agreement include: California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island. 
The MOU isn't legally binding, so this might be more wishful thinking than a clear-cut plan for now
The MOU isn't legally binding, so this might be more wishful thinking than a clear-cut plan for now. The states will have to develop their own policies or incentives to deploy all these heat pumps. But it shows how much hype there is around heat pumps in the fight against climate change. And with national climate policies hanging in the balance during upcoming presidential elections, state-led efforts become more crucial. 
'Even though it's not legally binding, it does plant a flag and set a strong shared target that states are collectively moving in this direction,' says Emily Levin, senior policy advisor at Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM). The nonprofit association of air quality agencies spearheaded the effort to adopt an MOU.
The plan also has some industry support from companies including Schneider Electric, Siemens, Ikea, eBay, and two of the biggest HVAC manufacturers, Trane and Carrier. They signed a letter of support for the MOU yesterday. 
'Climate change poses a significant risk to our long-term economic success, impacts the health and livelihood of our communities, and disrupts the value chains on which we rely,' the letter says. 'State adoption of more robust building decarbonization policies and programs will help us meet both business and state goals faster and more cost-effectively, all while reducing climate-related health and safety risks.'
Part of the MOU is to develop an 'action plan' to 'support widespread electrification of residential buildings,' essentially creating zero-emission buildings. State and local governments have had to pivot in response to the fossil fuel industry's fierce opposition to bans on new gas hookups, which 
killed a first-in-the nation plan in Berkeley, California
 that 
dragged gas stoves

Buildings are a major source of pollution, accounting for 
more than a third
 of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions globally. 
Fossil fuel combustion in buildings
 also produces more smog-forming nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions than power plants do in the US. Fossil-fueled heating equipment across the nine states that have joined the MOU create more than 138,000 tons of NOx and 6,000 tons of fine particulate matter pollution each year.

GMB members support ballot on strike action over allegations of bullying within union,Alexandra Topping,2024-02-06 19:08:53,full,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/06/gmb-members-support-ballot-on-strike-action-over-allegations-of-bullying-within-union,theguardian.com,Union has been implementing recommendations of 2020 independent report that found it institutionally sexist,"A row has broken out at the GMB, one of the UK's biggest unions, after members of its largest region supported a move towards industrial action over 'serious allegations of bullying and harassment'.
Staff in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside (NEYH) region overwhelmingly supported a consultative ballot on strike action – used as a shot across the bow when members want to raise a serious issue.
GMB employees, who are members of the Unite union, were asked to support an industrial dispute with their employer 'regarding the deteriorating culture of bullying in the NEYH region', which it said was affecting 'the mental and physical health and safety of our members'.
The union said if it received support it would 'enter into the dispute process to seek redress'.
A Unite spokesperson said: 'Last week serious allegations of bullying and harassment were raised by our members within the NEYH region of the GMB. We take all such matters extremely seriously.
'This has culminated in a consultative ballot indicating our members were prepared to take industrial action if these allegations were not quickly addressed. We will now be raising this matter with the GMB and expect all concerns to be thoroughly investigated.'
A GMB spokesperson said: 'When we receive information on this matter, it will be thoroughly investigated.'
In the wake of the vote, the union sought to allay fears and curb gossip related to the consultative ballot. In a leaked email sent on Tuesday, staff were urged to treat speculation or rumours with 'scepticism', along with assurances that all internal processes were being undertaken 'with complete fairness and total probity'.
In 2020 the GMB was described as 
'institutionally sexist'
 in a 
highly critical independent report
 from Karon Monaghan KC. Gary Smith 
was elected as general secretary in 2021
 and promised to implement Monaghan's recommendations in full, saying the union had to 'shed these practices and cultures that have blighted us'.
The Guardian understands that staff in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humber region have called for an independent barrister-led 'health check' on the union's progress in implementing the Monaghan report, which it said should look at the GMB's use of 'external lawyers and HR operations'.
Leaders at the union have reacted furiously, with Smith accusing those behind the move of trying to undermine 'all the good work' carried out at the union.
In a leaked email last week, Smith told senior staff the union been approached by the media about confidential internal processes and was under attack by people 'hellbent on undermining all of the good work we have undertaken together in rescuing our union from the chaos of the recent past.' The email states: 'We must keep moving forward and remain true to Monaghan in never again allowing abuses of power.'
The Guardian also understands that the taskforce put in place in 2021 to implement Monaghan's recommendations has been wound down. A spokesperson for the GMB said the taskforce had taken the work as far as possible, and implementing remaining recommendations from the report would now be overseen by the general secretary and president.
'Every leader in GMB now has an obligation to uphold and adhere to the spirit and principles of the Monaghan report,' they said.
'We recognise that securing deep-seated changes in culture is an ongoing process and leaders throughout the union are committed to achieving this. Good leadership is transforming GMB and delivering the better union our members deserve.'
A GMB spokesperson said 'a number of serious processes' were ongoing, which it could not comment on. But it said Smith had 'worked tirelessly […] to drive through positive change and rebuild our union to leave behind the dark days of the past.'
In November an
 independent inquiry
 into the situation at a waste services depot in Brighton 
heard accusations
 of racism, homophobia, threats of violence and sexual comments against GMB reps or people described as being protected by the GMB reps within the council.
At the time the GMB said the alleged behaviours were 'unacceptable', 
but added that it was 
'very concerned that this report fails the basic test of fairness' and was critical of 'sweeping allegations [...] made on the basis of anonymous, unsupported statements'.
MeTU organiser Claire Laycock, who broke
 a non-disclosure agreement
 in 2022 to accuse former TSSA transport union general secretary Manuel Cortes of harassment, which he denied, said unions had to work harder and move faster to become more inclusive and democratic.
'Monahan and Kennedy did a lot of work and spoke to a lot of people,' she said. 'So one of our objectives now is to push each union to actually implement all of the recommendations made.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Alexandra Topping,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a0204cba50dc815a783475ad4c6f09ba2f9eb4f/0_208_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef6b8fa3f0039d52f151c9acddea591e,False,@guardian,6.2480707,a4d84875f8d617dacd9c705d021f5617,"['GMB', 'bullying', 'harassment', 'industrial action', 'mental and physical health and safety']","Members of the GMB union in the north-east, Yorkshire, and Humberside region have supported a move towards industrial action over allegations of bullying and harassment, which are affecting the mental and physical health and safety of the members.",Yes,"The article is relevant to the NDA as it discusses issues related to bullying, harassment, and health and safety, which are important focus areas for the NDA.",Red,"{

UN warns of ‘epic suffering' in Sudan and appeals for $4bn in aid,Fred Harter,2024-02-07 16:46:45,full,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/feb/07/un-warns-of-epic-suffering-in-sudan-and-appeals-for-4bn-in-aid,theguardian.com,Ten months of armed conflict in the country has displaced nearly 11 million people and left half the population facing hunger,"There is 'epic suffering' in Sudan says the UN, where 
fighting between rival military factions since April
 has created the world's biggest internal displacement crisis and raised fears of state failure.
On Wednesday, the UN appealed for $4.1bn (£3. 25bn) to meet humanitarian needs, amid warnings by the UN's World Food Programme that people are starving to death in areas cut off by fighting.
Médecins Sans Frontières says a child is dying of malnutrition every two hours in a single camp in the North Darfur region. The medical charity described the situation as 'absolutely catastrophic'.
The war between the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated Sudan's economy. Half of the 
50 million population needs food assistance
 and nearly 11 million people have been uprooted from their homes, including 1.7 million who have fled into the neighbouring countries of Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Most of these countries are already dealing with their own internal crises.
'They have lost so much,' said Filippo Grandi, the UN's refugee commissioner, who recently visited Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia. 'Time after time, we hear the same message from them: we want peace so we can go home, and we need support to rebuild our lives.
'I urge the international community to step up their support for the people of Sudan,' Grandi added. 'They desperately need help, and they need it now.'
It is not known how many thousands have been killed during the 10 months of fighting. A leaked UN report says 10,000 and 15,000 were killed in a single town in the country's West Darfur region, where RSF fighters and allied Arab militias stand accused of going door-to-door killing members of ethnic African groups. The violence has raised fears of a repeat of 
the 2003 genocide by the Janjaweed
, the RSF's precursor.
The RSF appears to be gaining ground in the conflict, cementing its hold on Darfur and advancing into new areas of east and north Sudan. In December, it entered the state of Gezira, Sudan's breadbasket and a hub for aid agencies.
Efforts by regional powers, the US and Saudi Arabia to mediate a peaceful resolution have been unsuccessful.

The war has damaged Sudan's water supply and knocked out three-quarters of its health facilities, the UN said in its appeal. As a result, diseases including measles, malaria and cholera are surging, it said.
The UN's relief chief, Martin Griffiths, called on donors to provide funds to address the soaring humanitarian needs. 'Ten months of conflict have robbed the people of Sudan of nearly everything – their safety, their homes and their livelihoods,' he said. 'The generosity of donors helps us provide food and nutrition, shelter, clean water, and education for children, and to fight the scourge of gender-based violence and care for the survivors.'

received just 43%
 of that amount.

Dust busters: what's really in household dust and how to get rid of it,Adrienne Matei,2024-02-06 17:00:37,full,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/06/what-is-dust-cleaning-fire-smoke,theguardian.com,"Dust is full of seemingly benign detritus, but experts say it may also contain contaminants with concerning health implications","T
he first thing I noticed when I moved in with my boyfriend was that his apartment was dusty. Dust bunnies huddled behind the couch and TV, and thick, purplish deposits of what I called 'greasy dust' cloaked the windowsills, bookshelves and even old bottles on the bar cart.
This dust became my nemesis, reappearing quickly after I cleaned. I began to feel like it was our third roommate, an entity akin to Tim Curry's goopy character from the movie FernGully – tenacious, insalubrious and sinister.
We've all heard that dust is full of dead skin, hair and other seemingly benign detritus, but the sheer robustness of my greasy dust made me wonder: what 
else
 is really in the stuff, and could it be making our homes less healthy?
What is dust made of and is it harmful?
Dust has a lot of components. It contains things that are possibly irritating to our skin and airways, but don't pose major health risks, such as dead skin cells, hair, pet dander, bacteria and microscopic mites. According to a 2009 
study
 of household dust in the US midwest, about 40% of the dust in our homes comes from outside, via air or the bottoms of our shoes. This can comprise soil and other outdoor debris tracked inside from our shoes, and allergens like pollen.
But dust also contains chemical contaminants with more concerning health implications. 'Dust is basically a repository for indoor chemicals that have shed from various products,' says Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist researching indoor contaminants at the Environmental Working Group. Depending on where we live and what products we keep in our homes, these can include harmful 
PFAS
, chemicals often used to treat stain- and waterproof fabrics which have been linked to certain types of cancer and lower birth weights.
Dust can also harbor flame retardants, which typically shed from older foam furniture, and phthalates, which are found in air fresheners and plastics; both are linked to hormonal disruption and neurodevelopmental issues in children, among other health concerns. In homes where lead, asbestos and mold are present, these highly hazardous materials are also typically present in dust.
Additionally, dust can contain microplastics, themselves tiny parcels of chemicals.
Does household dust get into our bodies?
We are potentially exposed to harmful components in dust via ingestion, inhalation and skin contact, with researchers now understanding that humans can absorb chemicals from ambient household dust 
through our skin
.
Well actually button to read more
The authors of a 2023 
study
 from the University of North Carolina found that dust that has settled on our food containers, packaging and serving plates could actually be a more significant source of microplastic intake than our food. While there is no current threshold for the amount of plastics we can safety ingest, the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to microplastics and the chemicals they contain are 
detrimental
.
Stoiber says children, who may be crawling on the floor and putting their hand in their mouths, are at the greatest risk of exposure to the pollutants in dust; 
studies
 have found children eat on average 60 milligrams of dust a day, with adults consuming half that amount, in addition to being exposed through inhalation and dermal absorption. That's sort of like taking a small dust pill daily.
What about dust that results from wildfires?
With the northern hemisphere seeing 
record-breaking
 wildfires last year, and the average American breathing in more harmful wildfire smoke in 2023 than any other year since 2006, an increasing amount of dust from wildfire smoke is reaching us, especially if we live on the west coast or are within the range of an extreme wildfire event. This smoke contains a chemical component (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs), that 'can be in the air, but can also deposit as particulate matter on surfaces', explains researcher Aurélie Laguerre.
Laguerre says PAHs can enter our homes after wildfire events via our buildings' air filtration system. Landing as a thin 'black layer' of dust on your furniture, bedding and walls, PAHs remain hazardous for 40 days, exposing you to toxins even after the smoke in your area has cleared.
While the health effects of PAHs vary depending on factors like the duration, volume and pathway of exposure, these substances are 'very well-known for their human toxicity', says Laguerre.
Occupational exposure to PAHs are linked to higher incidences of lung, skin and bladder cancers. They exacerbate respiratory conditions, and researchers believe they may contribute to cataracts, kidney and liver damage, and jaundice. Some PAHs are known to be mutagens and teratogens, agents that can create genetic mutations and affect fetal development.
PAHs aren't only produced by wildfires. They can be created when we cook and partially burn food, and are also a component of car exhaust and pollution released by the industrial processing of petroleum.
Learning about PAHs made me reassess my greasy dust. Not only am I located on the west coast of Canada, where summer wildfires are frequent, but our building was next to a superhighway and an industrial area. All those times I idly swiped up a fingerful of windowsill gunk, I was probably scooping up landed particulate PAHs – gross.
What's the best way to get rid of PAHs dust?
Fortunately, there are many easy, affordable ways to mitigate all types of dust in our homes. In one of Laguerre's 
studies
, she and her team found commercially available cleaning products, like spray or foam glass cleaner, were able to remove 62% of PAHs from glass, and a regular cold laundry cycle and stint in the dryer reduced PAHs from bedding by 48%.
Running your kitchen exhaust fan while cooking, using a Hepa air purifier and keeping windows closed during wildfires or if you live near a busy road can all cut down on harmful particulate matter in your home.
What's the best, most comprehensive dusting technique?
According to Sharon Garcia, who runs the Los Angeles-based Next Level Cleaning Services company, the most effective way to dust a room is from top to bottom, using an extendable microfiber or lambswool duster to trap buildup that accumulates on walls and atop light fixtures, fans and high furniture. Then, she recommends vacuuming thoroughly with a Hepa-filter vacuum, as these are able to catch smaller particles than a regular filter (Garcia wears a mask while dusting for extra protection). For blinds, baseboards and windowsills, she's a particular fan of Scrub Daddy Damp Dusters, as wet materials capture dust effectively.
In her own home, Garcia launders her fabric curtains and vacuums her upholstered furniture and mattress every three months. She also uses a mattress protector to limit dust accumulation. 'If you've never cleaned your mattress, I'd recommend starting now, or hiring a professional to do it, and then getting a protector so you don't have to worry about it,' she advises.
If you want to go the extra mile, replacing carpet – which both accrues dust and can contribute to synthetic microfiber pollution – with wood flooring is a great step. But there are plenty of simple habits that go a long way to limiting dust getting into your home, and body, too: remove outdoor shoes before coming inside, wash your hands before eating and clean or replace your HVAC filter annually.",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Adrienne Matei,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc3bf73de7a7a801a7958eff3ecbe0dbd0abbeb/0_366_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64364b5886fd3f2a25a1a2848ce88a45,False,@guardian,6.0382447,6d5271096a436d666ffa45682c86aaf9,"['dust', 'health risks', 'chemical contaminants', 'microplastics', 'wildfire smoke']","The article discusses the composition of household dust, including potentially harmful components such as chemicals, flame retardants, and microplastics.

‘All good to take to school?': Australian influencers spruik flavoured nicotine pouches to vape-addicted youths,Natasha May,2024-02-06 23:59:18,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/all-good-to-take-to-school-australian-influencers-spruik-flavoured-nicotine-pouches-to-vape-addicted-youths,theguardian.com,Exclusive: TikTok users and Australian websites promote likely harmful products as a way to quit vaping – but TGA warns they can only be supplied with a prescription,"A
ustralian social media influencers are promoting highly controversial and likely harmful flavoured nicotine pouches in viral videos claiming they are an effective tool to quit vaping, as public health experts warn the increasingly popular products could become the next youth epidemic.
The teabag-like sachets are placed between the gum and lip and are similar to snus, which is popular in Scandinavia. But unlike snus, which contains tobacco, nicotine pouches contain nicotine extracted from tobacco or synthetic nicotine and are promoted as 'tobacco free'.
The pouches – which the World 
Health
 Organization warns are a growing 'public health concern'
 
– are being heavily publicised on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, with at least one post by an Australian-based fitness influencer garnering more than 2m views.
According to Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) the products require a prescription to be legally supplied in Australia. One website that ships the pouches directly to consumers maintains they are legal in Australia.
The nicotine pouches are being sold on several websites in Australia with flavours similar to vapes, such as 'bubblegum,' 'lemon spritz' and 'frozen cloudberry'. The products are manufactured by tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International's Zyn brand and British American Tobacco's Velo brand.
It comes ahead of a federal ban on 
non-prescription vapes
, which the health minister, Mark Butler, promised would halt the tobacco industry's attempt to create a 'new generation of nicotine addicts'.
A ‘healthier alternative'?
Videos from several young Australians proposing the pouches as an alternative to vaping have routinely garnered tens of thousands of views and hundreds of comments, with many asking where the products can be bought and 
one asking
, 'Are they all good to take to school?'
Stefan Kohut, 19, is an Australian fitness influencer with 13,700 followers on TikTok. 
He promotes the platform Snussaholic
 with a link to the website that sells Zyn, Velo and other nicotine pouches in his bio – and he has published 13 videos promoting the product.
In a 
video posted on 30 November
 with 340,000 plays Kohut explains how nicotine pouches are used
.
Kohut says it is 'just my personal take not advice', but notes nicotine pouches were the reason he hadn't vaped in four weeks.
In another video posted 23 January with more than 30,900 plays, Kohut says nicotine pouches offer a 'healthier alternative' to vaping or smoking, while in another 
 posted on 8 January
 with 12,600 plays, he says Snussaholics gave him an 'affiliate code' to offer his followers a 15% discount: 'for everyone trying to get off vapes snussaholic is where it's at'.
An affiliate code is customised so that the merchant can track where a customer came from and the referrer – often influencers – may get a commission.
 
Kohut warns: 'if you're under 18 these aren't for you. Or if you don't vape, or you don't smoke, or you're not trying to get off anything like that these aren't for you.'

Sydney-based fitness influencer Zahki Kapusta, 24, has more than 15,000 followers on TikTok.
His 30 December video
, 'Become your best self and quit vaping in 2024', has reached more than 2m plays. In the video, Kapusta advocates nicotine pouches as an effective tool to quit vaping, saying of the three times he's quit, using the pouches 'took the least amount of effort and was the easiest mentally'. 'The first time … I quit cold turkey which I still reckon is the best way to do it but by far this is going to suck the most.'
 



He says 'you might be more likely to get addicted [to pouches rather than nicotine gum], but 'the barrier to entry is pretty limited … you have to get it in the post.'
Kapusta has posted seven videos since 21 November featuring the use of nicotine pouches, some of which advocate them as a way to quit vaping, and in some cases using hashtags referencing the nicotine pouch '#zyn', or slogans such as 'quitvaping' and '#nicotine'.
Until recently his TikTok bio promoted a website called '
snusitout.com

We waited too long to see what would happen with vaping, and all of a sudden, we had a youth epidemic on our hands
Prof Becky Freeman
Following Guardian Australia's inquiries, the link to snusitout was removed from Kapusta's Linktree page .
Snusitout's website has been updated following Guardian Australia's enquiries, removing the reference to 'nicotine satisfaction' and now states 'we're committed to providing Australian smokers an aid in the cessation of smoking.'
‘Exceptionally high' levels of nicotine
The World Health Organization warns some nicotine pouches contain 'exceptionally high' levels of nicotine, an addictive chemical shown to effect the nervous and cardiac systems, leading to a faster heart rate and increased blood pressure. A 
British Medical Journal
 study found half the nicotine pouches it tested contained tobacco-specific compounds that can damage DNA and in the long term lead to cancer.
The WHO says 
sales of nicotine pouches
 are growing rapidly and that they are part of the industry's efforts to expand its portfolio of novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products.
The University of Sydney tobacco control expert Prof Becky Freeman said the websites
'
 marketing of nicotine pouches as a way to quit vapes and cigarettes was 'very insincere', while tobacco companies marketed nicotine pouches as a 'stopgap measure' in places where vaping was not allowed.
She said the extra step of flavouring the oral nicotine, with many of the same sweet candy flavours as vapes, is the reason they have 'taken off' among young people in the United States The Generation Vape study she leads has heard increasing anecdotes of nicotine pouch use in Australia.
'We waited too long to see what would happen with vaping, and all of a sudden, we had a youth epidemic on our hands,' she said.
Prof Emily Banks, an epidemiologist with the Australian National University and leading tobacco control expert, said there were registered safe and effective products for helping people quit such as nicotine gum, patches and inhalers.
'Addiction itself is a health issue … you only feel normal when you've got the product,' Banks said.
The TGA said it was aware of some nicotine pouches being advertised and supplied in Australia, adding it was monitoring the situation and taking enforcement action where it breaches the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.
The TGA says nicotine pouches can only be supplied with a prescription, or if they meet certain conditions such as being expressly indicated for quitting smoking and included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.
'No nicotine pouches have been approved by the TGA for use in Australia. The quality, safety or effectiveness of these goods as an aid in the withdrawal from tobacco smoking is not yet known, and their widespread marketing and use in the community is potentially harmful,' it said.
A BAT (British American Tobacco) Australia spokesperson said 'the websites named by the Guardian Australia are in no way associated with BAT Australia, BAT as a global entity or any of our trading partners'.
'These websites …should be shut down by the TGA immediately,' the spokesperson said.
Snusitout's website argues that nicotine pouches 'are legal in Australia'. It acknowledges that they fall under the TGA's poison standard unless they are prescribed by a doctor, are within tobacco prepared and packed for smoking, or 'prepared for oromucosal' or transdermal administration to 'aid in smoking cessation'.
Snussaholic's website state its products are not a smoking cessation tool and advises consumers to 'consult a healthcare professional before using nicotine pouches'.

The rodents are causing stress to some residents on Woodlark Chase, in Norbreck, Blackpool
A council said it had taken legal steps against a developer after residents were left with a rat infestation on their estate. 
Some residents on Woodlark Chase, in Norbreck, Blackpool, said they had seen rats in their gardens and under floorboards and spotted rat droppings.
One said a rat chewed through wires in her car, causing £600 worth of damage.
The council said contractors had employed a pest control firm last week to deal with the issue.
Some residents are partly blaming an attenuation basin, which is designed to collect excess rainwater, for the problem and said the rodents were coming up from the pipes there.

Jordan Robbins, who lives on the estate on Warren Drive, told the 
Local Democracy Reporting Service
: ""Rats have been seen sitting on windowsills and on bin covers. 
""We have rabbit hutches in our garden and it's a concern if the rats get near them.
""It's very unnerving to think about where they might be hiding or if they are going to scuttle past your feet when you go out into the garden. 
""It makes me shudder as the rats are huge.""
Another resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ""You're worried about letting the dog out on an evening because you're not sure what might be waiting in the garden.""
However, Richard Miller who also lives at Woodlark Chase, said he was not concerned.
""To this day, I've not seen one. I live right on the edge and not had a problem.""

Councillor Paula Burdess said contractors had employed the services of Rentokil to deal with the issue
's environmental health team have now stepped in to help solve the problem.
A council spokesperson said: ""Our investigations found rats had been coming into the residential area from a nearby watercourse. The water was at a higher level than normal due to the recent heavy rainfall.""
Councillor Paula Burdess, cabinet member for community safety, street scene and neighbourhoods, said: ""We have contacted the contractor and we have placed an order on them to get their own contractors in for pest control.""
She said they employed Rentokil last week ""who will be dealing with the problem"".
""We have contacted all the residents to let them what has been done... and we have had a public meeting and we will monitor the situation to ensure the ongoing pest control takes place,"" she said.
A spokesperson from Lovell Homes said: ""We are aware of, and have acted in response to, the pest control issues reported at Woodlark Chase.
""An environment officer has visited and confirmed an offsite ditch, not owned by Lovell or related to the development, was impacted by heavy rainfall with the resulting flooding leading to rat habitats being pushed on to the Woodlark Chase development.
""Lovell completed and left the site in December 2022 with the management company that is responsible for the development now continuing to work closely with the council to take further coordinated actions to eradicate the issue.""
's planning committee initially refused permission for the 86-home scheme to be built, after residents and councillors warned it would increase the flood risk in the area. 
But the decision was over-ruled by a planning inspector following an appeal by Lovell Homes and approval was granted in May 2019.

The treatment by police of a 13-year-old autistic boy is shocking – but it fits an appalling pattern,George Newhouse,2024-02-07 00:43:00,full,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/07/the-treatment-by-police-of-a-13-year-old-autistic-boy-is-shocking-but-it-fits-an-appalling-pattern,theguardian.com,"Our marginalised youth, those living with disability and First Nations people are policed in a way the majority of us would not recognise, nor tolerate","The Australian federal police website proudly states that one of its central roles is to 'play a lead role in keeping Australians safe from terrorism'.

So it's extremely disturbing to discover that the joint counter terrorism team (JCTT), which comprises Australian federal police, Victoria police and Asio members, has in fact been found by a magistrate to have actually radicalised an individual in the course of a counter terrorism investigation.

It's scarcely believable that, as the court found, the JCTT encouraged an autistic 13-year-old boy in his nascent and naive fixation with Islamic State. The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons and known by the pseudonym Thomas Carrick, is an NDIS recipient and has an IQ of 71. By any measure he is clearly an extremely vulnerable young man.

The JCTT waited until Thomas was 14 (and therefore criminally responsible) before charging him. Those charges were subsequently thrown out by Magistrate Lesley Fleming, who was scathing in her judgement:

'The community would not expect law enforcement officers to encourage a 13-14 year-old child towards racial hatred, distrust of police and violent extremism, encouraging the child's fixation on ISIS. 'The conduct engaged in by the JCTT and the AFP falls so profoundly short of the minimum standards expected of law enforcement offices [sic] that to refuse this [stay] application would be to condone and encourage further instances of such conduct.'

Under questioning in the Senate, AFP deputy commissioner Ian McCartney said it was not their 'intent' to further radicalise the boy during the undercover operation. 'The person was on the path to radicalisation long before we became involved, long before Victoria police became involved.'

As shocking as this individual case may be, it fits an appalling pattern in the way Australian police forces deal with the most vulnerable people in society. Our marginalised youth, those living with disability and First Nations people are policed in a way that the majority of us would not recognise, nor tolerate.

The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability found evidence of a systematic criminalisation of disability across Australia. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of New South Wales has found that NSW police were operating discriminatory programs to target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, which led to them being consistently overrepresented as targets of suspicion and criminalised as a result. A Wollongong University study found that bicycle helmet laws were being used for purposes unrelated to safety, including 'gathering intelligence about offences and suspects, justifying searches and harassing targeted individuals – particularly young Aboriginal people'.

These are just a few examples of intersecting and compounding forms of violence and harm that police cause to First Nations, LGBTQ+, culturally and linguistically diverse people and communities, young people and the elderly, people with disabilities and people experiencing mental ill-health, suicidal ideation, domestic, family and/or sexual violence, homelessness, poverty and substance use or dependence.

The reports and statistics are one thing. But behind every young person treated unfairly by the police lies a promising life in ruins, a family in distress and a nation failing its own people.

Meanwhile, we have seen with alarming regularity that when police are first responders to a person having a mental health crisis, it can have fatal consequences. National Justice Project lawyers have spent the past two years working for the family of one such man, Todd McKenzie, who was shot and killed by police when alone and having a psychotic episode inside his own home in Taree. The coroner will hand down her findings in early April.

The police have a responsibility to prevent crime but the criminal justice system should be a last resort where vulnerable lives are at stake. All efforts should be made to provide support to young people instead of delivering brutality and punishment. What is perhaps most disturbing about Thomas's case is that many of us believe that we can rely on the police to keep us safe but here the police took an active role in encouraging a highly impressionable young man to commit a crime. Instead of being the bulwark against crime, they were found by the court to have actively encouraged it. Instead of working with his family to de-escalate their concerns, the police further radicalised a teenager and then waited until he was old enough to charge him with a crime.

And why do the police act like this – with Thomas and so many other people on the margins of society? Because they can.

If Thomas had come from a wealthy family and attended a private school, would the police have acted the way they did? If you live with a disability or come from a vulnerable section of society, different rules seem to apply.

Sadly, in 2024 in Australia, some police appear to think it's standard operating procedure to criminalise being disabled, young, poor, LGBTQ+, being a person of colour or First Nations.

Steps You Can Take To Protect Your Premature Infant's Vision,William A. Haseltine,2024-02-07 16:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2024/02/07/steps-you-can-take-to-protect-your-premature-infants-vision/,forbes.com,Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease that has become increasingly common and significant in recent years.,"This story is part of a series on the current progression in Regenerative Medicine. This piece is part of a series dedicated to the eye and improvements in restoring vision.

In 1999, I defined regenerative medicine as the collection of interventions that restore tissues and organs damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time to normal function. I include a full spectrum of chemical, gene, and protein-based medicines, cell-based therapies, and biomechanical interventions that achieve that goal.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease that has become increasingly common and significant in recent years. As a result of advances in neonatal care, more premature infants are surviving. Still, they are also at higher risk of retinopathy of prematurity. This disease can lead to blindness and other visual impairments, causing lifelong consequences for individuals and their families. However, there is hope. Advances in treatment methods and ongoing research are improving the outcomes for premature infants with ROP.

What is Retinopathy of Prematurity?

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a condition that occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. This condition mainly affects premature infants, especially those born before 31 weeks of pregnancy or weighing less than 3 pounds at birth. The development of ROP is due to abnormal retinal development, which is likely associated with varying levels of oxygen exposure during pregnancy.

ROP has five stages, ranging from mild, in which the blood vessels grow only to the edge of the retina, to severe, in which the blood vessels grow through the retina and cause retinal detachment, leading to possible blindness.

Treatment options for ROP depend on the severity of the condition and the stage at which it is detected. In mild cases, the condition may resolve on its own without treatment. However, in more severe cases, treatment options may include laser therapy, cryotherapy, or surgery. In some cases, follow-up care, such as eye exams and monitoring, may be necessary to prevent further vision loss.

Effectiveness of ROP Treatment

Laser therapy is the standard treatment for ROP, which involves using a laser to produce minor burns on the outer edges of the retina. This procedure stops the growth of abnormal blood vessels and prevents further complications such as retinal detachment, scarring, and blindness.

Laser therapy is performed under local anesthesia and takes only a few minutes. The physician will use an ophthalmoscope to direct the laser beam to the affected areas of the retina. The procedure may cause mild discomfort, but infants generally tolerate it well.

Studies have shown that laser therapy is highly effective in treating ROP. The results depend on the severity of the condition and the timing of the treatment. In some cases, multiple sessions may be required to achieve optimal results.

Anti-VEGF drugs are a type of medication that can be administered via injections to help block the growth of blood vessels. These drugs are designed to work by inhibiting the protein VEGF, which plays a crucial role in forming new blood vessels. VEGF is responsible for promoting the growth of blood vessels by signaling specific cells to divide and multiply.

However, in some cases, such as when VEGF levels are too high, this can lead to the growth of abnormal blood vessels that can cause health problems. By inhibiting the action of VEGF, anti-VEGF drugs can help prevent the development of these abnormal blood vessels, which can be beneficial in treating ROP.

In severe cases of ROP, surgical interventions such as scleral buckle or vitrectomy may be required. A scleral buckle is a silicone band placed around the eye, which helps to relieve traction on the retina. A vitrectomy involves removing the vitreous gel, the transparent substance inside the eye, and replacing it with a saline solution.

Current Clinical Trials and Outcomes

Clinical trials are being conducted to investigate new ROP treatment and prevention methods. Some studies examine the use of stem cells to repair damaged retinal tissue. At the same time, others explore the use of gene therapy to suppress abnormal blood vessel growth. Further studies investigate the effectiveness of early vitamin A supplementation in reducing the incidence of ROP in premature infants.

Although some trials have reported promising outcomes, more research is needed to verify the safety and efficacy of these new methods. Nevertheless, advances in treatment methods, such as laser therapy, have significantly improved outcomes for premature infants with ROP, leading to better visual acuity and fewer cases of blindness.

With continued advancements in medicine and research, there is reason to be optimistic about the future of ROP treatment and outcomes for premature infants.",forbes.com,49,0,US,en,William A.

The World's Appetite For Seafood Is Soaring But Supply Lags As Fisheries And Fish Farms Seek Transparency,John Mariani,2024-02-07 15:15:45,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmariani/2024/02/07/the-worlds-appetite-for-seafood-is-soaring-but-supply-lags--as-fisheries-and-fish-farms-seek-transparency/,forbes.com,"The theme of the GSA's conference was ""unity.""","Last October in St. John, Canada, 340 people involved in every aspect of the seafood industry attended the Global Seafood Alliance's Responsible Seafood Summit to hear how their industry is faring. The good news for many was that aquaculture will need to supply two-thirds of the world's seafood requirements by 2030; without aquaculture, the world will face a seafood shortage of 50 to 80 million tons by 2030. Issues of sustainability were a major theme of the conference as well as a need for unity among the fishing industry and aquaculture entrepreneurs. The bad news for fishermen is the issue of dwindling supplies.

Authorities spoke of 'super impressive' growth rate in Brazil and Venezuela, and the great success of the Faroe Islands aquaculture, which since 2003 has been hailed for implementing some of the world's most stringent and comprehensive veterinary regulations, so that the Faroese Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture is now used as 'inspiration and guidance' for the implementation of sustainable aquaculture standards in other countries around the world. To find out the issues of concern to the seafood industry, I interviewed Steve Hedlund, founding EIC of Seafood Source and the GSA's Communications, Media & Events Manager for the GSA (though he has just taken a new position at Cooke Seafood) for the last eleven years.

The theme of the GSA's conference was 'unity.' What have been the divisive issues? Have the fisheries and the aquaculture industries been at odds until now?

The Responsible Seafood Summit is the world's only seafood event focused on bridging the differences and nurturing the commonalities between aquaculture and fisheries, with the goal of building a more unified front for seafood. It's not that fisheries and aquaculture are at odds. It's that there's not enough collaboration. That's what pre-competitive events like the Summit are designed to do – to bring together people from both fisheries and aquaculture.

You've said that 'the value of building transparency and trust with customers was also discussed. There's so much judging and misinformation out there that the seller-buyer relationship is more important than ever.' What is the public most concerned about?

The public is concerned about value and product quality. Even with sustainability emerging as a concern, value and product quality remain at the top. Consumers want a good quality product and good price. But increasingly they want assurances that the product they're purchasing was produced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. That's where third-party certification programs like Best Aquaculture Practices come in. Consumers who buy product with the blue BAP label know that they're buying product produced under strict standards for environmental and social responsibility, animal health and welfare, and food safety.

How has social media affected the way seafood is perceived?

Social media has given producers, big and small, a platform to talk about how they're doing things responsibly. They're able to reach consumers more directly, which is a good thing. The challenge is that there's a lot of misinformation out there, and this misinformation is spread more rapidly. That's why it's so critical for the industry to better collaborate, and to build a more unified front for seafood.

How did the pandemic affect the industry?

What happened during the pandemic was when restaurants were forced to shut down consumers bought seafood at supermarkets and cooked it at home, some for the first time. Consumers learned that seafood is easier to cook than the realized, especially first-timers, so they incorporated into their diet more often. When the pandemic subsided and restaurants opened back up, that trend shifted back. So retail seafood sales slowed post-pandemic. However, a whole new audience was introduced to seafood for the first time, and that will pay dividends for years to come.

Are there stringent international requirements for entering the industry?

There are. More specifically, retail and foodservice companies have strengthened their sustainable seafood sourcing policies over time. Many of their vendors are required to attain third-party certification, whether aquaculture or fisheries, to ensure that their seafood is farmed (and processed) responsibly or caught responsibly. It's a way of doing business now. Certification programs go above and beyond what a government may require and level the playing field. So if you're a retail or foodservice seafood buyer, you know you're getting product held to the same stringent set of standards no matter what country it's coming from. It's difficult to be a player in the international seafood scene these days without being involved in more or more certification programs.

Responsible seafood production is no longer a novelty – it's a way of doing business. Retail and foodservice companies worldwide employ sustainable seafood sourcing policies that require that the product they're purchasing was produced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. That's standard practice these days.

The predictions for growth of the industry seem to be soaring, but the industry cannot keep up with the demand?

It is true that aquaculture production continues to grow. Our own survey results indicate that the world's production of farmed will grow by about 4.8 percent in 2024 to almost 5.88 million metric tons (compared to 2023). Our own survey results also indicate that the world's production of the five species/groups of finfish – carps, tilapias, pangasius and catfishes, salmonids, and sea bass and sea bream – will grow by 2 percent to around 40.4 million metric tons (compared to 2023). Demand is also growing, as the global population rises and more people transition into the middle class. And as they transition to the middle class they upgrade their diets and eat more seafood, especially in Asia. That's what's fueling demand for seafood over time.

Is it true that many territories and species are being fished out? How is that preventable?

There are more sustainably managed fisheries around the world than there have ever been. Government bodies are strengthening their regulations, and more and more fisheries are attaining third-party certification through programs like Responsible Fisheries Management.

"Six months after Maui wildfire, 5,000 survivors still stranded: ‘We're tired of broken promises'",Nina Lakhani,2024-02-08 12:00:12,full,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-six-months-later-housing,theguardian.com,"Red Cross says only a third of households who sought emergency shelter have moved into homes, as governor's pledge rings hollow","Every afternoon Diana Tevaga rushes back from work to her hotel room to feed her pitbull, Pe'a, and tabby cat, Kenzie, bracing herself for another dispiriting evening searching online for an affordable apartment in Maui.

Tevaga, 41, has been living in a hotel since losing her home – a rent-controlled apartment she'd shared with her mother and pets – in the catastrophic Lahaina wildfire on 8 August. Before the fire, she spent evenings with her nephews and nieces, who lived in the same neighborhood. Now, Tevaga watches reality TV and eats Red Cross meals with other survivors who have no place else to go.

'As soon as I wake up, there's a physical tightness in my chest. I worry about where we will go when the help runs out. I am grateful, but this hotel is not a home, it's a shelter. It's not right that so many of us are still here. How can we dream about rebuilding when we don't have a stable home?' said Tevaga, wiping away tears.

Six months after the deadliest American fire in more than a century, almost 5,000 people are still in emergency hotel accommodation in West Maui, struggling to grieve and navigate the labyrinth of post-disaster bureaucracy amid throngs of tourists.

According to figures from the the American Red Cross, the non-profit contracted to manage the hotel program, only a third of the households who sought emergency shelter in the immediate aftermath of the unprecedented fire have so far moved into homes – places where they can once again cook, invite friends over and begin to recover.

Anger and despondency is growing as survivors in the hotels feel pressured to move off island or accept apartments far from work and school – even though West Maui has thousands of short term vacation rentals. The Red Cross shelter program is scheduled to expire in April.

Hawaii's Democratic governor, Josh Green, reopened Maui to tourists at the end of October, spending millions in marketing campaigns urging visitors to return and save the island – despite residents' pleas to wait until fire survivors had been rehoused. Since then Green has pledged – but failed – to issue a temporary moratorium converting some of the island's 27,000 short-term rentals into long-term housing for fire survivors.

Tevaga said she had been stunned when an agent with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had asked her about relocating off the island – a question displaced survivors are regularly confronted with by the Red Cross and Fema. She was furious when asked to consider apartments where pets are not allowed.

'Maui is my home, and these fur babies are my family. It is so traumatizing, having to repeat my story over and over again. I've worked with tourists my entire adult life, but I'm so angry that it's hard to be around them now. We're tired of broken promises … it's not easy staying hopeful,' said Tevaga, who was born and raised in Lahaina.

As tourists started to return to West Maui in early November, a group of young local residents erected a protest camp on Kaanapali Beach, a long stretch of golden sand and crystalline ocean where several high-end resorts are located.

'We set up in the tourism mecca of Maui, to push back and educate tourists that drinking mai tais will not save our economy, that tourism is stripping us of our land and water resources,' said Jordan Ruidas, co-founder of Lahaina Strong.

The sprawling encampment is impossible to ignore, and tourists must walk past a yellow and red sign listing the groups' demands: house the people; restore the wai [water]; heal the ‘āina [land]. Activists are pushing Green to at least issue a moratorium on the 2,200 or so unpermitted short-term rentals in West Maui, which would house most of the fire survivors and enable them to remain close to work, school, healthcare and each other.

'The housing crisis is not an inventory issue, it's a tourism issue … we'll be here until the governor stops putting profits over the people and drops the hammer on short-term rentals,' said Ruidas.

Six months on and the historic town of Lahaina is still a mess of scorched rubble, with efforts to remove the toxic debris only just getting under way. There is only one main road in and out of West Maui, so survivors must drive past the charred remnants of their lives. Traffic jams, high winds and sirens continue to trigger flashbacks and anxiety, as many continue struggling to process what they witnessed and lost.

The firestorm killed 100 people and razed more than 2,200 structures, mostly working-class family homes, with the estimated cost of the damage around $5.6bn, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).

While survivors are grateful for the help they've received, dealing with the bureaucracy – insurance companies, Fema, Red Cross, state and county agencies and health and safety experts, is extremely stressful and time consuming.

For some, it proved too much, and they opted out or moved away.

In a park a few miles north of Kaanapali Beach, brothers Glen and Ray Delatori are camped out waiting for the insurance company and health authorities to greenlight their return home – which was among a handful left standing in one razed neighborhood. 'I'd rather sleep in my car and be free, not like in the hotels,' said Glen, 68.

Anecdotal reports suggest that a small but growing number are being kicked off Fema's housing support list and the Red Cross shelter program with nowhere to go, but they no longer appear in the official numbers.

One morning in late January, Robert Elliott found a typed note from the Red Cross taped to the hotel room door, that said he was no longer eligible for housing assistance and had 48 hours to vacate the hotel – or start paying for the room himself. This was, the note said, because Elliott, 35, was not engaging in his recovery planning and had 'refused all solutions'. A second letter listed possible reasons for ineligibility, including failure to provide documents proving he had been renting in the now uninhabitable burn zone.

'I lost all my documents in the fire; I'm screwed. I have no plan,' said Elliott, who moved to Maui a decade ago and would be willing to return to the mainland, if he qualified for help. After leaving the hotel, Elliott procured some donated camping equipment and headed to Kihei, a coastal town south-east of Lahaina, with his dog, Biscuit.

A spokesperson for the Red Cross said the scale of the Maui shelter program was 'unprecedented', and that people could be discharged due to placement in an interim property, voluntary exit, breaking hotel rules or failure to maintain contact with the Red Cross and Fema, but most were given a week's notice. 'While nearly all survivors will be able to remain on Maui if they choose, we know that options are limited, and survivors are faced with difficult decisions. We recognize these are not easy conversations.'

'There seems to be a race to get to zero in the hotels, declare victory and transition into the recovery phase – even while the emergency for many survivors is still ongoing,' said Angus McKelvey, a state senator and fire survivor staying at the same beachfront hotel as Elliott.

'It could have been so different if we'd streamlined the bureaucracy, given people direct forgivable loans like in Covid, and dropped the hammer on the short term rentals … instead the community is being run out by voluntary relocation and the Fema gold rush.'

Dozens of tents are pitched along the shoreline. Some belong to people who were unsheltered before the fire; others include those deemed ineligible for housing assistance.

A series of well-intended state and county incentives, including tax breaks for vacation rentals and above-market-value rents for landlords housing fire survivors, have failed to solve the crisis.

Instead, Maui's already inflated rents have ballooned, and studio apartments in West Maui now cost as much as $5,000 a month on vacation websites. Social media sites are full of stories about landlords not renewing leases for long-term residents in order to cash in on Fema paying up to 175% above fair market rate rents – despite a ban on rent hikes while the emergency proclamation period remains in effect.

Fema said it would not knowingly enter into an agreement with a landlord who engages in this practice.

A spokesperson said: 'We know the importance of empathy during such challenging times, and we're committed to continuously improving our communication and support processes… [relocating to another island or the mainland] are options, however bothersome, we have to ask survivors along the way to offer a housing solution.'

According to Governor Green's office, 2,345 of 3,000 (78%) of the housing units needed to rehouse displaced survivors have been secured for Maui wildfire survivors. 'We should see survivors continuing to leave hotels and moving into safe, stable, and secure housing over the next 30, 60, and 90 days,' Green said.

A spokesperson for the state department of business, economic development and tourism said: 'Visitor expenditures continue to support Maui's economy – not just hotels, but locally owned restaurants, retail stores and visitor-geared businesses, many of them mom-and-pop operators. These small businesses employ Maui residents, many of them displaced by the fires and in need of continued employment to feed their families.'

The climate crisis is a risk multiplier. Extreme weather disasters like wildfires and floods tend to expose and exacerbate existing structural problems such as access to housing, land and water inequalities and gaps in insurance.

Last August's fire turbocharged Maui's affordable housing crisis – which dates back well over a decade, as investors converted residential properties into lucrative short term rentals for tourists drawn to the island's breathtaking beaches, tropical landscapes and ho'okipa – the Hawaiian word for warm hospitality.

Nancy Goode, a retired boat captain who lost her condo in the fire, is renting an apartment almost an hour away – the only place she could afford. Goode, 69, didn't qualify for assistance from Fema since she had homeowner's insurance, and she is living off the insurance lump sum and a stipend from the charitable fund set up for survivors by Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson.

But the condo was significantly underinsured, and rebuilding will be tough at her age. 'I'll need to remortgage or get a loan, but at 70 I don't even know if I can,' said Goode.

Hundreds of families have mortgages on homes razed by the fire and must negotiate deferments and forbearance deals with lenders individually. Many lack adequate insurance to cover the rebuild and face dipping into the money to cover the mortgage payments – or risk foreclosure.

Anastasia Arao-Tagayuna has received more than a dozen calls and letters from property companies offering to buy the family property that burned down. The property, which belonged to her deceased parents, was underinsured, and a large balloon payment is due on 1 March – unless she can negotiate another mortgage forbearance with the bank.

A right to switch off? Proposed new rules could ban bosses from contacting staff after work,Cait Kelly,2024-02-06 14:00:34,full,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/07/australia-work-industrial-relations-reforms-labor-albanese-government,theguardian.com,Albanese government is considering right to disconnect amendment to address the ‘Trojan horse for wage theft',"A phone call after you've left work. An email you need to check on a Sunday. A stream of texts over the weekend about a new project.

Increasingly, Australians are seeing their work seep into their home life – and now the federal government is making moves to tighten how much bosses can contact employees out of working hours.

A suite of reforms will be debated in federal parliament this week, as the government introduces its final industrial relations reforms on the gig economy and casual employment. The Greens are pushing to insert the proposed new right to disconnect into the reforms.

The minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, has spent the week in conversations with the Greens and independent senators David Pocock and Jacquie Lambie, who both held reservations about the legislation.

The right to disconnect has been legislated in countries like France and Germany for years, but in Australia it has been included in a handful of enterprise agreements, including for police and teachers.

While business groups say legislating the right to switch off is unnecessary and could lead to the loss of jobs, some unions support it while others want more movement on unpaid overtime.

Jessica Heron, an industrial lawyer with Maurice Blackburn, said Australian industries have traditionally adopted the right to disconnect through enterprise bargaining agreements.

'That has required a unionised workforce, which, typically comes with more rights and entitlements than an un-unionised workforce,' she said. 'But how it's policed is going to be completely different for each industry.'

During the Senate education and employment legislation committee last year, teachers from the Independent Education Union of Australia said the technological shift over the past few years meant teachers were always contactable by parents, which was leading to burnout.

Teacher Abigail Butler, from the Independent Education Union of Australia, said the pressures – which were in part driven by constantly needing to be contactable – meant she was thinking of changing careers.

'We are humans as well, we need sleep and we need time with our families,' Butler said.

In 2022 Queensland public school teachers voted overwhelmingly on a deal that would give them the right to disconnect from work, unless there is an urgent or exceptional circumstance.

The vice-president of Queensland's Teacher Union, Leah Olsson, said it was triggered by members feeling pressure to reply to parents and management at all hours.

Since then, some teachers had put out-of-office replies in their email signatures, saying emails would only be checked within certain times. Some schools used their newsletters to communicate expectations around when teachers will be contactable.

'It just puts a clear boundary in place to let people know that teachers and school leaders won't be responding, or will only be responding within these times,' Olsson said.

'It really reflects a growing recognition of the importance of work-life balance, and also to the need to be able to protect the wellbeing of our workers, especially in this digital age.'

In 2019 Victoria police adopted the right to disconnect – also with caveats. If the situation is deemed to be an emergency or an individual's safety is threatened, superiors are allowed to contact officers, although they are meant to be paid for out-of-hours contact.

'The intent is to support a culture of rest and separation and to aid overall health and wellbeing,' a Victoria police spokesperson said.

'The change has been well received among our workforce, with feedback overwhelmingly positive.'

‘$100bn a year in lost wages'

For the past 15 years, the Australia Institute's Centre for Future Work (CFW) has been tracking the amount of unpaid overtime across the country and says, on average, workers do 5.4 hours of unpaid work each week – or 280 hours of unpaid overtime a year.

'That's in excess of $100bn a year in lost wages across the whole economy,' economist and director at CFW Jim Stanford said.

'The problem of unpaid overtime is not new but it's taking new forms. The boundary between your work and your life is getting fuzzier and fuzzier.

'Increasingly, because of technology, it takes the form of being asked to perform work-related tasks when you aren't anywhere near work – at home, out and about, even when you're on leave, because you can't escape your mobile phone, your email and your WhatsApp.'

On Radio National on Tuesday morning Burke said it was 'unreasonable' workers were expected to work out of office hours and not get paid.

'The starting point of workplace relations law in Australia is meant to be that when you work, you are being paid to work,' he said.

Burke said it was completely reasonable for employers to send emails or contact people for shifts, and the government didn't 'want to get in the way of that'. Instead of legislating punitive measures against employers, such as fines, the government is looking at instead protecting workers from penalties if they don't engage.

Mark Morey, secretary of Unions NSW, said that to have its full effect, the right to disconnect must be accompanied by 'a ban on unpaid overtime for people earning less than $150,000'.

'Technology is more than a disruption to personal and family time. It's the Trojan horse for wage theft. Implementing an unpaid overtime ban alongside a right to disconnect would have a powerful legal effect but also establish healthy new work norms and culture.'

But Andrew McKellar, chief executive officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the amendment, which has not been presented yet, could impact women's participation in the workforce.

'This sort of heavy-handed legislation risks taking Australia back to a rigid working environment that is undesirable for parents, especially women,' McKellar said. 'This rigidity also undermines the case for working from home, which appeals to many employees with family responsibilities.

'This is adequately dealt with by existing laws. It's not necessary to prescriptively enshrine conditions of employment in this way.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Cait Kelly,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01551292da4892bb8d46140b886220b4f53965df/0_144_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=774d9b46fc9e7984097df55b8f9afc9d,False,@guardian,4.4834986,e33b610488e2ba0c6c719d7ede4613e3,"['right to disconnect', 'unpaid overtime', 'work-life balance']","The Australian government is considering reforms to tighten how much bosses can contact employees out of working hours, with the proposed right to disconnect being debated in federal parliament.

The Cyber Threats Every C-Level Exec Should Care About In 2024,James Foster,2024-02-08 13:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/the-cyber-threats-every-c-level-exec-should-care-about-in-2024/,forbes.com,Everyone in the C-suite needs to have a sense of their company's risk landscape and that includes cyber threats and risks.,"James C. Foster is the chairman and CEO of ZeroFox

As business leaders and corporate officers, cybersecurity risks may not always be the first thing on your minds. But in the ever-evolving digital age, the role of executives extends far beyond traditional domains.

In 2024, everyone in the C-suite needs to have a sense of their company's risk landscape and that includes cyber threats and risks that can affect their company's reputation, employee and customer data and, potentially most importantly, the financial bottom line.

Ransomware And The SMB Challenge

Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) find themselves in the crosshairs of escalating ransomware attacks. Operating within the constraints of aging network infrastructures and grappling with insufficient cybersecurity budgets or enterprise-level cyberdefense tech stacks, these organizations are perceived as easy targets by cyber adversaries.

To address this challenge effectively, business leaders must recognize that resilience against ransomware is not solely a technological matter, but also a strategic one.

Preparing for the growing threat of ransomware means fostering a culture of cybersecurity preparedness from the ground up. Allocating resources judiciously, investing in employee protection and leveraging cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions are pivotal components of this multifaceted approach. By adopting a proactive stance and integrating cost-effective measures, SMBs can significantly enhance their ability to thwart ransomware attacks.

Strategic investment in cybersecurity must also start at the top, with CEOs championing a culture of vigilance and creating an environment where cybersecurity is not just a buzzword but an integral aspect of daily operations.

A Surge In Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

In 2024, my intelligence team anticipates a shift in threat actor tactics, as they pivot away from traditional methods of data exfiltration towards a heightened focus on exploiting vulnerabilities like CitrixBleed for increased financial gain. Notably, ransomware collectives like CL0P are actively engaged in the development of zero-day exploits, resulting in a significant annual rise in victim counts.

For business leaders, the repercussions of a zero-day vulnerability surfacing within their organization's software extend beyond immediate operational concerns to potential reputational damage. As attackers prioritize characteristics inherently associated with zero-day exploits—stealth and simplicity—executives must simultaneously establish comprehensive response protocols that emphasize both speed and effectiveness to keep their organization secure.

Institutionalizing a culture of rapid response and adaptability enhances the company's overall cyber posture and better positions it to counter the evolving threat landscape of zero-day exploitation in 2024. Collaboration with industry peers via sharing of threat intelligence is also crucial here—building a collective defense against zero-day vulnerabilities involves raising awareness, breaking down silos and fostering a sense of community resilience.

The Evolution Of Phishing Techniques

Phishing, perhaps the most 'traditional' digital security threat, is evolving into an increasingly sophisticated attack vector. Beyond the traditional email-based method of using malicious attachments, cybercriminals now employ SEO poisoning and URL cloaking to deceive even the most vigilant victims.

Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) operations run by cyber criminal organizations are also on the rise due to their low prices and high sophistication. These services offer a lower entry barrier for threat actors, which allows for new hackers to conduct relatively complex attacks.

Adopting an organization-wide, external cybersecurity program is the modern approach and overall best defense against these new methods of phishing.

AI's Role In Cybersecurity

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into corporate technology stacks is an undeniable trend. But there's a looming question that remains unanswered: Is this new technology truly secure? When it comes to AI, business leaders must exercise due diligence in balancing innovation with security. The allure of generative AI offerings must be tempered by a thorough understanding of potential risks.

The complicated nature of AI, as well as the complex nature of leveraging it, will lead to a modest but steady increase in the capability to defend, inform, protect and, unfortunately, abuse digital and cyber assets.

In the case of information operations, AI will continue to be used in support of malicious activities, accelerating the pace and realism of media used to trick victim users into divulging high-value credentials, system access, financial information and other sensitive information.

Business leaders must enhance current cybersecurity programs to formally account for the risks and rewards of AI, including hiring or contracting a subject matter expert (SME) to support activities that involve leveraging vendors that have incorporated AI for defensive purposes and for defending from AI-enabled threats. Maintaining situational awareness of AI-enabled threats, and a strong operational response capability regarding these risks, is also imperative.

Furthermore, engaging in ethical AI practices and staying abreast of evolving AI regulations becomes a key responsibility for business leaders—transparency in AI deployment and a commitment to responsible use align with broader corporate governance objectives.

"Ransomware gangs ‘staged comeback' last year, says crypto research firm",Dan Milmo,2024-02-07 13:48:03,full,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/07/ransomware-gangs-staged-comeback-last-year-says-crypto-research-firm,theguardian.com,Chainalysis says hacking victims paid out a record $1.1bn following lull in 2023,"Ransomware gangs staged a 'major comeback' last year, according to research, with victims of hacking attacks paying out a record $1.1bn to assailants.
Cyber criminals stepped up their global operations in 2023 after a lull in 2022, with victims including 
hospitals
, 
schools
 and 
major corporations
.
Payments to criminal gangs in the wake of attacks doubled compared with 2022 when $567m was paid out, a report by the cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis found.
It added that 'big game hunting' had become a feature of attacks last year, with a greater share of ransom payments costing $1m or more as wealthier entities were targeted.
Chainalysis said: '2023 marks a major comeback for ransomware, with record-breaking payments and a substantial increase in the scope and complexity of attacks — a significant reversal from the decline observed in 2022.'
Ransomware attacks typically involve hackers entering a target's computer system and paralysing it with malware, which encrypts files and makes them inaccessible. A new trend in attacks involves assailants extracting data from the IT system, such as staff or customer details. The gang then asks for payment to unlock the files or to delete their copy of the stolen data.
Chainalysis said a number of factors contributed to the payments dip in 2022, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Most ransomware groups are linked to eastern Europe, former Soviet republics and Russia in particular, with Chainalysis reporting that some rogue actors were either disrupted or shifted their focus from ransomware to politically motivated cyber-espionage. One major hacker group, Conti, disbanded amid internal upheaval after an anonymous leaker who expressed sympathy for Ukraine released 60,000 internal messages.
The FBI also disrupted the Hive ransomware group by capturing its decryption keys and saving victims from making $130m in ransom payments.
Chainalysis also cited research showing that attacks last year showed a growth in the number of attackers and ransomware variants.
'A major thing we're seeing is the astronomical growth in the number of threat actors carrying out ransomware attacks,' said Allan Liska, analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.
According to Recorded Future, there were 538 new ransomware variants in 2023, which indicates the emergence of new, independent groups. The Clop group emerged as a significant player last year, claiming responsibility for the hack of payroll provider Zellis which 
targeted a vulnerability in MOVEit software
, which is used to transfer files around internal networks. Affected customers included British Airways, Boots and the BBC.
The British Library is still recovering from a ransomware attack by a rebranded group, Rhysida, that 
hit the institution in October
. The library has declined to pay a ransom.
The growth of 'ransomware as a service', where malware is hired out to criminals in exchange for a cut of the proceeds has also stoked activity, along with 'initial access brokers' who sell vulnerabilities in the networks of potential targets to ransomware attackers.
Ellie Ludlam, a partner specialising in cybersecurity at UK law firm Pinsent Masons, said she expected the increase in attacks to continue.
'This increase is expected to continue in 2024 and with an ongoing focus on mass data exfiltration by threat actor groups, which holds the potential for higher ransom payments by impacted companies,' she said.",theguardian.com,60,2,GB,en,Dan Milmo,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66ae9c18a22b5c5d134c22ef9a3549357eb7c899/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=373d4559b5df61ec903d2ed6fce66b97,False,@guardian,11.406651,7f0b359c570c0922fe80de48a06f7a9b,"['Ransomware', 'Cybersecurity', 'Attacks', 'Payments', 'Victims']","Ransomware gangs made a major comeback in 2023, with victims paying a record $1.1bn to hackers.

Amazon's Kuiper Orbital Internet System Will Include Important National Security Features,Loren Thompson,2024-02-06 15:39:57,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2024/02/06/amazons-kuiper-orbital-internet-system-will-include-important-national-security-features/,forbes.com,"Kuiper is a commercial venture, but its design delivers big national security benefits.","Sometime later this year, probably near the holidays, Amazon AMZN will begin offering broadband internet service from orbit via its Kuiper Systems subsidiary. The project has been in development since 2019, and its first satellites were launched in October of last year.

The project is conceptionally similar to the SpaceX Starlink constellation, offering low-latency connections around the globe to billions who lack reliable internet access.

However, Kuiper is doing more than simply making high-speed internet access available from low earth orbit. It is incorporating features into its constellation of 3,236 satellites that will make the project highly resilient against electronic jamming, cyberattacks, and other threats to U.S. space assets.

The most noteworthy such feature is laser crosslinks between the satellites in the constellation, which will create a mesh network in space nearly impossible to disrupt. If satellites in the network are attacked, connections can be instantly rerouted to other nodes so that no degradation in service occurs.

This kind of resiliency is very important to the Pentagon, which has long feared that attacks against U.S. space systems might leave the joint force blind at the onset of war.

The Kuiper architecture makes that much less likely, and the government is already investigating how it might take advantage of the new system to bolster U.S. defenses.

Amazon, a contributor to my think tank, successfully demonstrated how the laser crosslinks would operate on its first two satellites last fall, moving 100 gigabits of data per second.

That's a hundred billion bits, and each satellites in the system will be connected at that level of functionality. The link architecture is all the more remarkable because Kuiper satellites will operate in nearly a hundred orbital planes, with each satellite moving at 25,000 kilometers per hour.

Data moves about 30% faster through the vacuum of space than it does through terrestrial fiber, so Kuiper's mesh network will move vast amounts of information at speeds not feasible on the Earth's surface.

But that is just the beginning of how Kuiper could provide a unique resource to commercial, civil and military users. The project has developed a family of customer terminals that is smaller and lighter than other such systems, with throughputs ranging from 100 megabits per second to a gigabit per second.

The latter, high-end terminal, would likely be the one favored by military and corporate users. The 100 mbps terminal is more than adequate for any residential use, but also can easily be adapted for use at the tactical edge where warfighters often have difficulty securing adequate connectivity.

The Kuiper system will utilize a dozen ground stations that are part of the Amazon Web Services infrastructure. The ground stations assure that satellites stay in proper position using electric propulsion that Amazon developed for each satellite, and provide links to the terrestrial internet network.

But thanks to the laser crosslinks between the satellites, Kuiper is not confined to serving customers near ground stations. It can link directly to previously disadvantaged users, such as warships far out to sea and aircraft traversing remote land masses.

Like the crosslinks in space, the signals between satellites and surface users would be very difficult to for an adversary to jam or intercept. Kuiper has leveraged lessons learned from Amazon's cloud computing business to assure the network is protected from cyber intrusions.

Although Kuiper is a primarily a commercial venture assembled using $10 billion in Amazon capital, it is already in talks with the U.S. Space Force about how its system can supplement military satellites to assure wartime connectivity for the joint force.

At the very least, it will provide an alternative to, and competition for, the Starlink system that has proven so useful in opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

There is, however, one potential obstacle to realizing this vision. Outdated federal policies concerning spectrum sharing need to be adjusted to facilitate introduction of the system, and other operators of satellites in low earth orbit are resisting the changes.

The details are complicated, but it's pretty clear that companies like SpaceX do not welcome the arrival of a competitor with deep pockets such as Amazon. Starlink is already experiencing some softness in customer demand, so a similar service with low prices and novel features would be problematic for SpaceX.

Nonetheless, modifying current spectrum policy is the easiest way to inject competition into a sector destined to transform global commerce and culture. Enabling Kuiper to achieve its full potential is thus desirable for both economic and security reasons.

Beyond Checkboxes: Security Compliance As Business Enabler,Varsha Agarwal,2024-02-06 14:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/06/beyond-checkboxes-security-compliance-as-business-enabler/,forbes.com,"The security leader, in partnership with senior management, has to foster a culture where commitment to security compliance is embedded throughout the organization.","Varsha Agarwal is the Head of Information Security at Prosper Marketplace.

It's no surprise that today, regulatory requirements of the business landscape are increasing in complexity. The idea of any compliance, let alone security compliance, conjures up images of stringent regulations, time-intensive audits and the daunting task of keeping up with new regulations. However, shifting our perspective will reveal a completely different narrative—one in which cybersecurity compliance isn't just a mandatory checkpoint but an important business enabler.

The security leader, in partnership with senior management, has to foster a culture where commitment to security compliance is embedded throughout the organization. The best way to do so is to drive a change in the narrative around security compliance, which can be done by conveying how strong cybersecurity compliance can catalyze business growth and serve as a business enabler. Here are some important points to share with your teams.

• Cybersecurity As A Trust Builder: Have you ever wanted to do business with a company that you are not comfortable sharing your personal data with? I did not think so. In an era when data breaches are rampant, customers are increasingly vigilant about with whom they trust their personal data. Compliance builds confidence that their data is secure. This trust translates into customer loyalty, repeat business and brand reputation.

• Facilitating Global Market Access: Compliance is no longer a box you need to check to avoid regulatory fines. Different regions have varying data protection laws and standards, and to enter those markets, compliance is not just a choice but a necessity. Regulations such as GDPR and CPRA require companies to comply to operate in those markets.

• Cybersecurity As A Competitive Advantage: Businesses are constantly seeking factors that set them apart. Having a strong security compliance program is a unique value proposition that can help businesses stand out in competitive markets, especially where data sensitivity is paramount. It's a powerful way to communicate that a company doesn't just prioritize security as a concept but follows through with internationally recognized practices.

• Driving Automation And Operational Efficiency: The path to compliance often requires companies to rethink their operational processes. Compliance will scrutinize processes prone to human error that can be automated. This naturally results in higher efficiency, fewer compliance exceptions and a lot of employee satisfaction.

• Fostering Innovation With Secure Data: No businesses can survive unless they continually innovate, and to be able to innovate, businesses need access to secure data. A compliant cybersecurity posture provides a secure foundation upon which businesses can innovate without the looming fear of data breaches. With the spread of AI—which requires large amounts of data to learn from—this becomes an even bigger need.

• Cost Savings In The Long Run: While compliance can require initial investments in people, processes and technology, the long-term benefits outweigh the costs. Noncompliance can lead to expensive fines and fees. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023, ""The global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was USD 4.45 million, a 15% increase over 3 years."" Cyber insurance costs also increase significantly when companies do not have a strong cybersecurity compliance program in place. In a market where it is already difficult to get cyber insurance, poor compliance can make it all the more challenging to secure cyber insurance, let alone reduce premium costs.

Cybersecurity compliance is a journey that goes beyond mere adherence to regulations. It's about integrating security into the very fabric of the business. By viewing compliance as a strategic enabler rather than a regulatory burden, businesses can transform their cybersecurity practices into key drivers of success, innovation and customer satisfaction. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the role of cybersecurity compliance as a business enabler will only become more pronounced, distinguishing those who lead from those who follow.

Protecting Intellectual Property In A Borderless World,Emil Sayegh,2024-02-06 18:52:07,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/02/06/protecting-intellectual-property-in-a-borderless-world/,forbes.com,"In today's world of cyber infrastructures, it's critical to prioritize issues that transcend physical borders, especially the safeguarding of intellectual property.","Recent global and domestic headlines have highlighted discussions about borders and national sovereignty. It is a natural subject, given the concept of countries and borders has been a fundamental aspect of our world for centuries, shaping our identity, politics —and the way we perceive security. Given these challenges, it is prudent to question the significance of traditional borders and to explore a shift in focus towards bolstering the protection of intellectual property (IP), particularly in the context of cybersecurity. As we discussed in prior articles, several cyber groups, including those funded by foreign intelligence agencies such as China, Russia and North Korea, are often more interested in IP theft than actual monetary gain.

The Borderless Concept

Dispensing with the idea of countries and borders might initially appear radical. But like it or not, the concept of a borderless world is something being pondered today. The notion of a world without borders has been the subject of discourse in various contexts, emphasizing a shift in focus from conventional territorial boundaries, trade, and territorial disputes. The borderless shift is not unlike the swift movement of global digital assets and commerce that describes modern commercial cloud systems. With so many critical cyber assets put into cyber infrastructures, many argue it is increasingly critical to prioritize issues that transcend physical borders, especially the safeguarding of intellectual property.

To put this into the context of intellectual property (IP) protection and national security, look no further than the news of a recent government panel and public statements made by FBI Director Christopher Wray. Topped off by Director Wray, the heads of intelligence agencies from the ‘Five Eyes' alliance came together publicly for the first time to issue a dire warning about the growing threats to intellectual property posed by competing and threatening nations. Wray went on to call out one such nation, China, as the ‘defining threat of this generation ' in a '60 Minutes' panel.

Why Emphasize IP Protection?

Intellectual property encompasses a wide range of creations, from patents and copyrights to trademarks and trade secrets. Since the initial emergence of business computing, digital IP has become one of the most valuable assets for businesses and nations alike. Protecting intellectual property isn't just about safeguarding corporate profits; it's about maintaining technological leadership, fostering innovation, and ensuring national security.

The primary objectives of recent warnings are clear: Intellectual property protection must assume a central role in national security strategies. Here are several key reasons for this imperative:

Economic Resilience: Intellectual property theft exacts a considerable toll on the global economy, resulting in billions of dollars in annual losses. Nations with robust IP protections are better equipped to capitalize on innovation and safeguard their economic interests.
Fostering Innovation and Technology Leadership: Protecting IP instills confidence in innovators that their creations will remain secure, thereby promoting continuous innovation and maintaining global technological leadership.
Safeguarding National Security: In an era where technology and information are inextricably linked, the compromise of sensitive intellectual property can have severe repercussions for national security. From military technologies to critical infrastructure, IP theft can erode a nation's ability to defend itself effectively.
Diplomatic Considerations: Intellectual property issues have emerged as a significant point of contention in international diplomacy. Addressing IP concerns diplomatically can help foster stable and peaceful international relations.

From Assets To Liability

IP can be a tremendous asset to a company, and can be thought of as their crown jewels. If it is stolen, only to be replicated without the cost of R&D, and the long development journey including the blood, sweat, and tears of the entrepreneur, it can be devastating. Emotions aside, IP thefts from hardware, to software, to services, have risen to become national security issue draining billions of GDP from our countries. The recent warnings by intelligence chiefs are just the tip of the iceberg, underscoring the urgency of this matter. By emphasizing IP protection, we not only safeguard economic interests but also bolster innovation, technological leadership, and national security. But where do we go from here?

2024: Strong Cybersecurity Principles Still Rule

The process to protecting IP - and national security - begins with implementing strong cybersecurity principles, Zero Trust architectures, continuous monitoring, and as-built security architected to the highest standards. Organizations play a critical role in the process, and must reassess priorities on behalf of their colleagues, their companies, and the nation. It is vital that we afford as much, if not more, significance to safeguarding intellectual property as we do to securing physical boundaries. The future of innovation, economic prosperity, and national security is inextricably linked to our commitment to this cause.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,4,US,en,Emil Sayegh,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c27e3ec7ef27fff07ed6e2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,12.006224,a9c7ffa3054f6909a651e231faa563a3,"['Borders', 'National Sovereignty', 'Intellectual Property', 'Cybersecurity', 'IP Protection']","The article discusses the shift towards prioritizing the protection of intellectual property (IP) in the context of cybersecurity, highlighting the growing threats to IP posed by competing nations.

How Technology Can Be A Tool For Transparency In Public Safety,Kalyn Sims,2024-02-08 11:15:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/how-technology-can-be-a-tool-for-transparency-in-public-safety/,forbes.com,"Creating greater transparency, given all this available data, is a complicated, multifaceted initiative.","Chief Technology Officer of Hexagon's Safety, Infrastructure & Geospatial division.

If you watch the news or read the morning headlines, you're sure to be bombarded with calls for increased transparency from government and public safety agencies.

There is plenty of information the public would like to easily access: daily crime reports mapped and made available online; traffic cameras that give drivers a sneak peek at their commute; offender registries detailing where the worst released convicts live; and video and audio from body and dashboard cameras.

Creating greater transparency, given all this available data, is a complicated, multifaceted initiative. To be successful, it requires several layers of technology to provide the needed insights that could lead to positive change in community relations.

Citizen Access

Too much data can be a challenge. Storing, managing and analyzing it is a monumental task on its own. Beyond data collecting, data sharing is also a complicated problem to solve.

One solution to balancing transparency in data sharing and public trust is a citizen access portal, which gives community members a digital conduit to report crimes to police or report simpler matters like potholes and public nuisances to the city. Leveraging Next Generation 911 tools also allows people to send data to emergency communications centers via text, video or even footage from a drone or doorbell security camera.

Data sharing from the public doesn't even have to be an official transaction with the government. Smartphone videos of an incident in progress or public works complaints already often end up on social media where they can spur government action.

Transparency Vs. Privacy

Unfortunately, full transparency is rarely achievable when agencies must consider individuals' privacy. It may seem easy to release incident videos from bodycams and dashcams to fulfill the public's right to know, but the agency must first protect the privacy of bystanders or even confidential informants. The public often expects that footage is to be released immediately, but in reality, the video might take weeks to review and redact.

So how do agencies avoid protests and public conflict with grieving families or concerned citizens? They may not be able to altogether, but public angst could be toned down if procedures and timelines for releasing such videos are published and made public in advance. At the very least, agencies can be transparent in their procedures, even when legal factors keep them from releasing all the data they have promptly.

Growing that trust from the public also requires internal vigilance against cyber threats. Agencies should shore up their cybersecurity protocols by instituting best practices such as password protection and multifactor authentication. They should also back up and encrypt their data and make sure employees are getting regular training in cyber threat awareness.

Ahead Of The Game

In addition to the data agencies are already collecting, more requirements are likely coming from the federal government. Presidents Trump and Biden have each signed executive orders mandating the creation of a national database regarding the use of force and other police actions, indicating a trend toward mandated transparency.

In the future, the Department of Justice is launching the National Law Enforcement Accountability database, and public safety agencies need to be ready to comply when it goes online by having modern, searchable and shareable data management solutions.

Local agencies that can tell their communities they are ahead of the game in collecting and sharing accountability data can take a big step forward in regaining public trust.

12 Cybersecurity Measures To Defend Against The Rise Of AI And Quantum Computing,Carlo Tortora Brayda,2024-02-07 18:15:46,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/07/12-cybersecurity-measures-to-defend-against-the-rise-of-ai-and-quantum-computing/,forbes.com,"Phishing, insecure credentials and poor security are all problems that still need to be addressed and undermine existing data encryption solutions.","Executive Chairman of the Tortora Brayda Institute and Co-Founder of the National AI & Cybersecurity ISAO.

As a United Nations Judge on artificial intelligence innovation, I often emphasize the need for organizations to fortify their data security strategies to withstand the challenges from the accelerating pace of AI and quantum computing. Issues like phishing, insecure credentials, and lax security continue to fuel large-scale data breaches.

To help leaders combine various protocols and data protection measures, I asked members of the Cybersecurity Group, a community I lead through Forbes Technology Council, to share crucial steps to defend against the inevitable disruptions brought about by advancements in the quantum era.

1. First, take stock of how your data is currently accessed.

Quantum computing may require new forms of encryption when it finally becomes viable, but in the meantime, organizations need to look instead at how data is accessed. We have solid encryption solutions today, yet still large data breaches. Phishing, insecure credentials and poor security hygiene are all problems that still need to be addressed and that undermine existing data encryption solutions. - Thomas Kranz, Thomas Kranz Consulting

2. Leverage human behavior with a manual key.

Have an admin manually enter a key to create a pairing encryption key that cannot be guessed by powerful computing during a firewall setup. The algorithm does not use the key entered but truly measures the random time-lapse of keystrokes by the human typing a random string. The same logic can be applied to overcome the fact that quantum computing can decrypt any secret keys. Human behavior is the secret factor. Governance and controls are the key additional layers. - Alon Bender, BenderXpert

3. Build a robust data loss prevention program.

Having a robust data loss prevention (DLP) program can safeguard sensitive data through identification, vigilant monitoring and protection. DLP can ensure the integrity and confidentiality of valuable information, inspiring trust and confidence in data security practices. - Mani Padisetti, Digital Armour

4. Identify your organization's internal champions.

Organizations should prepare for AI and quantum computing-based security threats by identifying internal champions who can pinpoint the organization's most critical and riskiest data, where it resides, how it's backed up, and evaluate if the practices around encryption and obfuscation are sufficient enough to mitigate against technological advances. - Lila Kee, GlobalSign

5. Avoid a 'harvest now, decrypt later' attitude.

We need to closely watch the ""harvest now, decrypt later"" attitude, since RSA security is at high risk with quantum computing. This high risk must be resolved before quantum computing becomes mature. The QC powerhouse needs to look at the asymmetric encryption methods as a whole like RSA, ECC and DH. These methods might become obsolete, so there should be a greater discussion about these issues. - Kiran Palla, Department of Treasury (IRS)

6. Shift to crypto-agile solutions.

Quantum computers aren't magic: They won't break all things security or all things cryptographic. Instead, public key algorithms will be the main casualty. Organizations need to shift to crypto-agile solutions that can evolve their crypto over time without dev projects. For AI, data is critical and luckily there are new solutions to encrypt AI's memory (ie. vector embeddings). - Patrick Walsh, IronCore Labs

7. Invest in post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

Invest in the development and implementation of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. These cryptographic methods are designed to be secure against both classical and quantum computers, thus providing a robust solution to potential quantum threats. Encouraging education and public-private partnerships for their rapid adoption will further enhance our data security infrastructure. - Amitkumar Shrivastava, Fujitsu

8. Focus on your organization's key management.

Cyber is only as good as the weakest link, and while everyone likes to talk about AI and quantum, the reality is that the biggest threat to crypto is key management. Many organizations still use the same, static keys and store them with the data. Key management needs to be the primary focus. - Eric Cole, Secure Anchor Consulting

9. Have a designated team to evolve with NIST standards.

Assign a person or small team to get smart on the issue, or partner with a firm specializing in quantum. The transition from classical to post-quantum cryptography will be long and complex, but essential to the digital economy. Don't buy or build systems that cannot be upgraded to new NIST standards in 2024, because they will soon be obsolete. - Denis Mandich, Qrypt

10. Pinpoint your current encryption solutions that lack flexibility.

Develop a catalog of all encryption used in the organization. Then, explore each solution's ability to swap one crypto algorithm for another. Press vendors to develop the ability to change algorithms. Visibility and agility are vital for managing cryptosystems in a modern enterprise: You can't manage the cryptosystems you don't know about, and it's difficult to manage those lacking flexibility. - Peter Gregory, GCI Communications

11. Regularly review your IT and OT footprint.

For most organizations, the far more pressing threats are from ransomware and financial crime groups that exploit well-known and documented vulnerabilities, including out-of-date cryptography. Invest in asset management processes to regularly review your IT and OT footprint and audit systems for configuration vulnerabilities, including out-of-date encryption suites. - Elliott Wilkes, Advanced Cyber Defence Systems

12. Collaborate with industry researchers.

Collaboration between security researchers and various industries is key in standardizing efforts to influence the development of quantum-safe protocols and standards to avoid a ""Q-Day"" — the day quantum computers render all current encryption methods meaningless. - Ronald Martey, GCB Bank PLC",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,2,US,en,"Carlo Tortora Brayda,Council Post,Forbes Councils Member",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3a3b80af25169e08bdbaa/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,8.225735,3567cf28923b4e0dd8c417a394ad08e6,"['data security', 'encryption', 'quantum computing', 'cybersecurity', 'data breaches']","The article discusses crucial steps to defend against disruptions brought about by advancements in the quantum era, including taking stock of data access, leveraging human behavior for encryption, building a robust data loss prevention program, identifying internal champions, shifting to crypto-agile solutions, investing in post-quantum cryptography algorithms, focusing on key management, and collaborating with industry researchers.",Yes,"The article is relevant to the NDA as it discusses cybersecurity risks, specifically related to data security, encryption, and quantum computing, which are important areas of concern for the NDA.",Yellow,"{

Amazon Pharmacy Layoffs: Company Cutting Hundreds Of Medical Staff In Latest Round Of Job Losses,Cailey Gleeson,2024-02-06 21:46:27,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/caileygleeson/2024/02/06/amazon-pharmacy-layoffs-company-cutting-hundreds-of-medical-staff-in-latest-round-of-job-losses/,forbes.com,The latest round of cuts was announced in an internal memo Tuesday.,"Topline

Amazon Health Services is cutting 'a few hundred' employees from its One Medical chain and Amazon Pharmacy, the company announced Tuesday, marking the latest round of job cuts after a brutal 2023 for one of the nation's largest private employers.

Key Facts

Forbes obtained a copy of the internal memo from Amazon Health Services' Senior Vice President Neil Lindsay, which said the layoffs will impact 'a few hundred roles' in the One Medical chain, a ' membership-based primary care practice ' comprised of in-person and virtual care services which Amazon acquired for $3.9 billion last February, and Amazon Pharmacy.

Lindsay told employees the retailer 'identified areas where we can reposition resources' to make investments in 'invention and experiences' that directly impact customers and members.

According to Lindsay, the retailer's health care businesses have seen 'tremendous growth,' with Amazon Clinic seeing a '96% customer satisfaction rating'—adding that the company will 'continue our mission to make health care simpler"" in a statement to Forbes.

Those impacted by the layoffs will receive 'financial support, benefit continuation, and career assistance' throughout the transition, and 'an opportunity to apply for new roles in the organization,' Lindsay said.

Big Number

Over 27,000. That's how many employees Amazon and its subsidiaries have laid off since the start of 2023. Amazon employed 1.5 million full- and part-time employees as of the third quarter in 2023, according to Statista.

Tangent

On Tuesday, Docusign also announced it was laying off about 6% of its workforce, or around 440 employees, as part of a restructuring plan. Amazon is one of many companies that have announced rolling layoffs to cut costs over the past couple of years, reversing pandemic-era hiring, which resulted in a near 200% increase in layoffs in 2023.

Key Background

Amazon alone laid off more than 27,000 workers last year, after announcing it would cut 18,000 employees in late 2022 and another 9,000 in early 2023. This year has seen several rounds of smaller layoffs thus far, as the retailer has already announced hundreds of cuts to its Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions. Audible, an Amazon subsidiary, also cut more than 100 employees in early January. The layoffs come as the company attempts to cut costs and recover from overexpansion incurred during the pandemic, the New York Times reported. The tech giant experienced its best profits since 2021 in its 2023 third quarter earnings report, which saw $143.1 billion in revenue—beating estimates of $141.5 billion.",forbes.com,49,3,US,en,"Cailey Gleeson,Forbes Staff","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c2a7449e492d93f40425b6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2437,1372,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@forbes,12.106656,b3f4afa7dae755aa751db5050f610f1e,"['Amazon Health Services', 'job cuts', 'layoffs', 'One Medical chain', 'Amazon Pharmacy']","Amazon Health Services is cutting 'a few hundred' employees from its One Medical chain and Amazon Pharmacy, marking the latest round of job cuts after a brutal 2023 for one of the nation's largest private employers.",Yes,"The news article is relevant to the NDA as it discusses job cuts and layoffs in Amazon Health Services, which could have implications for jobs and skills in the workplace.",Yellow,"{

'Gen Z—more than any other generation—is more acclimated to consuming video content as their source of truth, news or opinion,' Adam Robinson, founder and CEO at recruiting software company Hireology, told me in a recent interview.

Even some job platforms are following suit.

The 'feed' allows students to swipe through job postings, events such as career fairs, alumni reviews and advice, as well as short-form videos created by employers, another new tool. In my latest story, I spoke exclusively with Handshake cofounder Garrett Lord about the revamp and what it means for Gen Z job seekers—and the companies who want to hire them.

The new design comes amid a tumultuous job market and continued layoffs (see below for the latest news). Yet, Lord says there's still demand to hire employees, including college students.

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

Watch for these red flags during the interview process.

If you have a toxic boss, there are ways to cope that don't involve quitting.

But if you are quitting, here's how to write a thoughtful resignation letter.

First job? Here are steps to budget.

Amanda Clark, Chief Operating Officer, International at Papa Johns

Prior to joining Papa Johns in 2020, Amanda Clark worked at Taco Bell and Procter and Gamble. Interesting enough, the COO studied theater and psychology in college. I sat down with Clark to discuss nonlinear career paths and her advice for climbing the corporate ladder.

Many employees end up in a job different from what their major was. How has studying theater had an impact on your career?

Having a theater background actually does help in business—because first of all, you have to present quite a bit, so it definitely helps with all the presentations and even with general communication.

You have to have an open mind in your career. Maybe I had a different thought when I was starting out my career that it would really be a straight line: 'You major in this and you go on to do this. I'm a psych major, maybe I'm going to go on to run a clinic.' And sometimes you change. You get exposed to new things, and I think people need to keep an open mind and also know that sometimes—and I used to roll my eyes when I'd hear this when I was younger—your career isn't always a straight line. Sometimes it zigs and zags to get to the place that you ultimately want to get to. If you keep the destination in mind, the journey may look very different than what you originally set out to have it look like.

Did you always picture yourself in the C-suite?

First of all, you've got to start with yourself and ask, 'What do you want to be as an employee, and what do you want to contribute?' Then you can start to influence teams.

I always thought it would be great to have the opportunity to really influence culture from a higher level and also have an opportunity to maybe give some people a chance that others would have overlooked in certain business settings. I've been fortunate to have been able to do that and have that opportunity, so I think that's one of the reasons why I always aspire to be in that C-suite and be able to help people just like I was helped from different points in my career by those same people.

What are employees getting wrong about 'climbing the corporate ladder'?

I feel in the early 2000s, there was this trend of making your opportunities your strengths, and there was a big focus on that. For me personally, I was a psych and theater major. There are some things that I'm really good at, and there are some things that I'm just not going to be great at. I'm never going to be an accountant. And when that trend came along, I was so focused on my opportunities and how I can be better at accounting, for example, that it made me lose the sense of what I was good at, and it made me lose a lot of confidence. That's just not the right way to go about it.

What you want to do is focus on making your strengths superpowers and just knock those strengths out of the park. When I think about how I use that now with my teams, I look at my teams as individuals and what their individual strengths are, and I try to balance them. I don't try to make everyone a perfect person. I try to balance the team as a whole, understanding each individual's strengths.

What's your advice for progressing one's career?

My advice for people who want to climb the corporate ladder, so to speak, is to be yourself and to be your authentic self and to embrace your strengths. Turn those into superpowers, and find an organization that values those things, because that's exactly how you're going to be successful. If you're always trying to fit the mold of something that you aren't, you're working too hard and it doesn't need to be that way. You're masking the strengths that you really have.

The automated helper can also answer more specific queries about a job posting, company benefits or culture, or the industry a job is part of. LinkedIn is making the same tools available to help users extract career advice from posts and articles shared on the platform's feed.
The updates attempt to solve a longstanding problem: 
Job hunting sucks
. Rohan Rajiv, a director of product management at LinkedIn, likens the process to having to climb over a high wall. The applicant is on one side, unable to see what a company wants to see in a job candidate or what the likelihood of getting an offer. 'You're really hoping that you can reach out to the other side of the wall and figure out: What are my chances here? What is it like to work there?' Rajiv says.
Some job seekers are already used to tapping AI for help. The advent of generative AI has spurred the appearance of tools that 
apply to jobs automatically
, 
recruit candidates
, and write 
cover letters
.
LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, OpenAI's most significant backer, which has rolled out a series of 
AI powered 'copilots'
 to help people get things done at work with its productivity tools. The work-centric social network is adding these features in beta mode as the tech industry confronts another uncertain year marked by 
more layoffs
.
More than 400,000 people have lost jobs in the past two years, according to 
Layoffs.fyi
, a site that tracks layoff announcements in the tech industry. LinkedIn itself cut more than 
600 workers
 last fall. Job seekers have described a 
nightmare hunt for work
, spending their 9 to 5 applying for new roles for weeks.
Although getting laid off is rarely welcome, the current state of the tech industry is relatively favorable to job seekers. The industry's unemployment rate sits at just 2.3 percent, according to a 
January report
 from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. That's lower even than the record low set this month by the US national unemployment rate, 
at 3.4 percent
, according to the Department of Commerce. And there are 392,000 open roles in the tech industry across the US, according to CompTIA.
Even in a favorable job market, securing a new position is often a lengthier process than it has been in the past. Employers have broadened the application process, adopting complex candidate management platforms and requiring more interviews, working interviews, and tests.
The average recruitment process in the US now lasts 43 days, according to 
2023 research
 from The Josh Bersin Company, a human resources advisory group. Many job seekers feel burned out. A 
February report
 from CompTIA found that nearly half looking for jobs in the tech industry cite the time commitment required as a top challenge. The same survey found evidence that workers are adopting tech-powered shortcuts: 17 percent of respondents had used AI to match their skills to a potential job, while 30 percent said they planned to do so.
WIRED took LinkedIn's new AI job hunting feature for a spin this week. The helper judged that a staff writer's profile was well aligned with tech and business reporting jobs at other companies, but less suited for management roles in media because the profile did not mention any management experience.
WIRED also asked the tool to evaluate the writer's fit with an open product management job at a social media company, and it said the profile was not well suited to product management but listed what relevant skills could be added to a LinkedIn profile—if applicable—to make it a better match. For a technical writer role for a software development company, calling for writing ability in a different context, the chatbot broke down which skills on the writer's profile were relevant and highlighted a few that could be added or emphasized.
LinkedIn's new tool can also help speed up the process of making sense of a lengthy, jargon-filled job posting. The chat window can list the benefits and perks offered by a company, break down a job description into challenges and opportunities, describe the interview process, and answer follow-up questions. If asked, it will even suggest LinkedIn profiles of workers at the company who might be able to discuss a job opening.
The same tools can also be used to help make sense of posts and articles shared to the LinkedIn feed—think Sparknotes for lofty and long-winded Linkedin posts. Initially, the platform won't offer the AI feature on every post, but when it does it will provide summaries and personalized advice about how a person could incorporate the content into their own career based on their field.
If the impact of past job-seeking and hiring tools is any guide, LinkedIn's new features could have a complex impact. Anything that makes finding and applying for jobs more efficient can potentially flood companies with applicants. Some recruiters already report that 
generative AI has increased their workload
—increasing the pressure for companies to 
use their own automation
 to review applicants.

Companies Laying Off Making Substantial AI Investments

Amazon

Online retailer Amazon announced on Tuesday it will be culling ' a few hundred roles ' in its One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy units. The company has had a steady stream of layoffs in 2024 in other divisions, including Prime Video, MGM, Audible, Buy with Prime and Amazon Pay units.

In an internal memo from Amazon Health Services' senior vice-president Neil Lindsay obtained by Forbes, Lindsay said that the company 'identified areas where we can reposition resources' to make investments in 'invention and experiences' that directly impact customers and members.

CEO Andy Jassy said last week in Amazon's earnings call, 'Gen AI is and will continue to be an area [of] pervasive focus and investment across Amazon primarily because there are few initiatives that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes.' Jassy projected that this technology will 'drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.'

Google

Google recently laid off hundreds of employees across various functions, including its advertising, sales, engineering, hardware and Google Assistant teams. These job cuts were about 'removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas,' according to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.

In January, Pichai warned his employees in an internal memo about the possibility of more 'role eliminations' at the company in the coming months. 'We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,' he wrote in a message to Google staff that was obtained by the Verge. 'The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.' Pichai told employees that 'some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted.'

In an earnings call last week, the chief executive said, 'We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.'

He added, 'Across different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas.'

Echoing Pichai's sentiments, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company is moderating expense growth by exhibiting a 'slower pace of hiring,' as she points to the 'headcount down year-on-year.'

Microsoft

Last month, Microsoft eliminated 1,900 gaming roles, impacting about 8% of Activision Blizzard, Xbox and ZeniMax employees. In an internal memo to staff, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote, 'As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.'

In addition to the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has a substantial $13 billion investment and 49% stake in OpenAI, the company behind chatbot ChatGPT.

In his earnings call last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told investors, 'We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.'

In talking about the future of work, Nadella said, 'A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as a 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks.'

In scaling Microsoft's AI and cloud investments, the company remains 'focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team.'

When discussing how the organization is able to make margin improvements, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors the company is 're-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce.'",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,3,US,en,"Jack Kelly,Senior Contributor","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3de6abc259ee73c349cab/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1688,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@forbes,5.4985385,38f90ca5f0f2e3a2d5134136c1bc5237,"['AI', 'jobs', 'layoffs', 'investment', 'technology']","Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will lead to the loss or diminishment of 300 million jobs in the US and Europe by 2023.

Recruiters Are Not The Enemy (But They're Not Career Coaches Either),James Hudson,2024-02-07 14:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameshudson/2024/02/07/recruiters-are-not-the-enemy-but-theyre-not-career-coaches-either/,forbes.com,Having a clearer understanding of how the talent market is operating today is a helpful first step towards helping you find your next role,"The talent market was built on asymmetry, and in the post-pandemic environment those asymmetries have become so significant as to make the whole thing become unworkable. Put another way, while there has always been a signal-to-noise issue, the 'noise' is now so loud that it's drowning out legitimate actors in the market, making the role of the recruiter almost untenable.

Until corporate recruiting tools (the dreaded ATS) catch up with the significant advances in consumer-facing technology, it's going to become even more difficult to navigate the increasingly crowded job market. It can seem overwhelming to be one applicant amongst a thousand for an open job posting, and much of the trending advice about how to get hired appears contradictory.

Having a clearer understanding of how the talent market is operating today is a helpful first step towards helping you find your next role. Central to that is an understanding of what role recruiters play in your job search, and perhaps most crucially, and understanding of what they don't do.

The Role Of The Recruiter

A recurring source of frustration for folks posting on LinkedIn (and other social media platforms), is that they 'can't get recruiters to respond to them', which gets to the heart of perhaps the single biggest misconception of how recruiters operate. A related question frequently posed is 'how can I find a recruiter to work with' – both of which highlight a fundamental disconnect in the understanding of what role recruiters are playing:

Job seekers believe that recruiters are there to help them find a job, whereas recruiters are there to ensure jobs get filled. That might sound like two sides of the same coin, but the nuance here is at the core of all the online frustration. Put simply, the recruiters' responsibility is tied to the open role, and only extends to the job seeker if that person is a candidate for that specific vacancy. While many job seekers believe that they are viable candidates for these roles, that decision is in the sole purview of the recruiter and the hiring manager.

Unfortunately, you cannot 'opt in' to being a candidate: you can submit an application, but the recruiter and hiring manager decide if you're a viable candidate, and at that point make the decision whether to engage with you.

The 3 Main Types Of Recruiter

To make things even more complicated, not all recruiters are doing the same work, and broadly speaking fall into one of three main categories:

1. Agency Recruiters: these folks operate in the middle ground between companies and candidates and in many respects have the hardest job of all, because they're often operating in a highly competitive environment with minimal information. Companies reach out to agencies when the internal recruiting team is at capacity, or when they're looking for niche skills which agencies often specialize in. These types of recruiters work in the same way as real estate agents in that they only get paid when they fill a role.

2. Executive Search: the clue here is very much in the name! Broadly speaking executive search firms take assignments for roles with base salaries of $250k or higher. Unlike agency recruiters, executive search operates on a retained basis, meaning that you pay part of the fee up front, and you pay the full fee whether they fill the role or not. Given that the fee can be 33% of total first year compensation, this gets very expensive very quickly, and therefore usually only represents a very small fraction of a hiring strategy. We typically only pay for these services in highly confidential situations – e.g., someone is currently in the job we're trying to fill (they don't know they're about to be fired) or we want to hire a new skill which would reveal a new corporate strategy that we don't want our competitors to hear about ahead of time.

3. Internal Recruiters: recruiters that are employed directly by the company (this role is where I have spent the bulk, though not the entirety, of my career) are the recruiters that you will encounter most frequently, and are typically the first stage of the process when you apply to an open role. Internal recruiters are typically juggling anywhere from 5-40 open roles at any given time, and are therefore working with a very large universe of stakeholders (hiring managers, interview panelists and candidates). While candidates are of course an important constituent, their primary stakeholders are the hiring managers attached to their open roles. Furthermore recruiters aren't truly decision makers in the way folks often think, rather they are executing against a set of parameters (minimum qualifications) set out by the hiring manager.

What Should You Expect Once You Are A Candidate

Like all professions, there are recruiters that are good, bad and indifferent, and it's not my goal here to blindly defend the profession as a whole. Once you're engaged as a candidate on a role these are the things that you can expect from a good (or even great) recruiter:

Frequent communication (weekly, or even daily, depending on where you are in the process)
Clear guidance on the salary and total compensation associated with the role
Coaching + preparation ahead of interviews
Debrief calls after interviews
Advocacy (we fight your corner, plus we're always trying to secure you the highest salary we can)
An outcome (while we often can't give you feedback, we'll always give you an answer)

It is unfortunate that the state of the current talent market (recruiting teams disproportionately impacted by layoffs, the imbalance between legacy recruiting tools and rapidly advancing consumer-facing AI tools) means that it's a struggle for recruiters to maintain these service levels, however many recruiters that remain in-seat are doing their best!

Remember that as a job-seeker you need to focus your energies on finding the right opportunities, and all of those opportunities will come with a recruiter attached. In many respects it's the gift-with-purchase that you didn't know you needed. Some recruiters will be great, and you'll end up forming a career-long relationship. Some will be not so great, but as their services are always free to you, you can choose who you want to build a long term relationship with, with very minimal risk.

Reframing a recruiter as a partner, rather than a gatekeeper, will help get the relationship off to a good start.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,3,US,en,James Hudson,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c291e0e4aeabb02465777b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,5.025457,a00f5e098a6b8fd45ba7c381dd64122b,"['Recruiters', 'Job seekers', 'Role', 'Internal recruiters', 'Agency recruiters']","The article discusses the role of recruiters in the job market and highlights the misconception that recruiters are there to help job seekers find a job.

This Gen Z Jobs Site Wants To Give Employers A TikTok Alternative,Emmy Lucas,2024-02-06 17:01:02,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmylucas/2024/02/06/this-gen-z-jobs-site-wants-to-give-employers-a-tiktok-alternative/,forbes.com,"Handshake is creating a social media-style feed for its popular jobs platform for college students, adding video tools for employers to match less buzzy companies with young job seekers—and connect with a generation that lives by the medium.","On TikTok, there are more than 2.6 million posts with the hashtag #WorkLife—videos providing 'PTO hack' advice for taking time off, outtakes discussing career buzzwords like ' Bare Minimum Mondays ' and short clips describing a 'day in the life' at companies like Google or Deloitte. Most recently, young workers have even been filming themselves getting laid off, posting wildly viral videos of the once-private moments and creating new headaches for employers. For Gen Z, online video is as much a part of their work lives as it is their personal experiences.

And yet, the job search platform perhaps most associated with college students—Handshake, which counts some 15 million of them as users of its platform —has been designed more like a job board without video than a social media tool filled with it. Until now. On Tuesday, the popular platform is launching a 'feed'-like interface and new video features it hopes will give companies a more direct line to communicating with Gen Z candidates in the style they prefer—and job seekers a more centralized place for discovering opportunities they might not otherwise find.

Garrett Lord, Handshake's cofounder and CEO, hopes it will 'level the information playing field,' he told Forbes in an interview. 'It feels a bit disconnected on Reddit or TikTok,' he says of employers' videos about their companies. Handshake aims to be 'the place where all the jobs, career fairs and conversations come together.'

Employers have already hopped on the social media trend, creating their own 'day in the life' videos and promotional clips that cater to young job seekers. But in a digital world of content overload and an endless choice of platforms like Glassdoor and TikTok to find employee reviews and interview insights, it can be hard for candidates to find those videos unless they're actively seeking out a specific employer's career site or TikTok handle.

Rolling out the new design amid a tumultuous job market and continued layoffs—particularly in the tech and media sectors—is a feature, not a bug, Lord says. While full-time job posts on Handshake, like many job boards, were down 24% in 2023 thanks in part to the tech sector's slowdown, and revenues were just above $120 million—roughly similar to 2022—Lord says he's continuing to see 'an incredible amount of demand' for college students. The new features could also help less buzzy employers find tech workers concerned about job security in that industry.

'Some companies are doubling down in this environment because Big Tech isn't hiring as much,' Lord says. 'That could mean there are more great software engineers for automotive or finance companies to hire.'

Handshake's new features include a redesigned app—which only advertised job postings and recruiting events before—that now acts as a scrollable feed similar to other social media platforms. It allows students to swipe through job postings, events such as career fairs, alumni reviews and advice, as well as short-form videos created by employers, another new tool. 'This is very much in the zeitgeist of what students want and expect,' Lord says.

The idea is to provide job seekers with a more engaging view of the companies they're applying to and interviewing for—one that goes beyond bullet points on a job board or a slickly produced video of managers boasting about strong company culture. For Gen Z, video is king, says Adam Robinson, founder and CEO at recruiting software company Hireology. 'More often than not, the first page a job seeker views after looking at the list of jobs are the case studies and videos,' he says.

Yet that also means it's a high-stakes move for employers, one that can backfire if the videos come across as too promotional or lacking in credibility. Young job seekers, says Robinson, 'can see through a scripted, choreographed and overly produced video' with surprising ease.

Arizona State University junior Mehul Kumar Srivastava says videos have been key when looking for internships. 'Job descriptions don't really tell you what's actually happening at a company,' the computer science major says, adding that the 'day in the life of an intern' videos show him what to expect. 'That's really motivating, because you want to be there.'

Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, says the 'feed' and social media-style scroll features are designed to add a level of serendipity to college students' job search process, giving those who may not know what type of career they want or what employer they want to work for a way to discover new roles and companies. 'The old setup put a lot more onus on the student to know what they wanted to find and to have a clear idea of what they want to look for in a specific job,' she says.

Handshake's new interface uses students' profiles—their major, selected location, companies of interest and the college they attend—to curate the jobs and posts they see in their feeds, showing students employers they may not have considered before or connecting them with alumni for advice. For employers, the new interface is designed to connect employers with a wider range of candidates.

Companies including TikTok, Teach for America and L'Oréal have been testing out Handshake's short-form video option, which is being released Tuesday as an early access program that all of its 900,000 employers on the platform can now request to join at no added cost.

At L'Oréal, group vice president of talent acquisition Emma Shuttleworth says the move is part of a larger effort at the company to attract young workers. She says the marketing team enlists a Gen Z taskforce to help inform young applicants and make videos they'll actually watch. On Handshake, the beauty company shares videos about their hiring process and longer-form 'masterclass' videos about specific skills such as how to run a new marketing campaign. Shuttleworth hopes 'it allows us to be at the forefront of students' minds,' she says, 'and in front of students who maybe have never considered applying to L'Oréal before.'",forbes.com,49,3,US,en,"Emmy Lucas,Forbes Staff",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c26165a0e377364a28b4f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@emmyrlucas,4.9851294,3c1475e38918fadf26c61137a1bebb4b,"['Handshake', 'video features', 'job search', 'Gen Z', 'employers']","Handshake, the job search platform, is launching new video features and a 'feed'-like interface to provide a more engaging view of companies for Gen Z job seekers.

Pakistan's election: Can the next government bring economic stability?,Abid Hussain,2024-02-07 08:37:57,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/7/pakistans-election-can-the-incoming-government-bring-economic-stability,aljazeera.com,There will be no honeymoon period for winners of this week's pivotal 2024 polls as economic challenges loom large.,"Islamabad, Pakistan –
 It is often tempting to declare every election as the most significant in a country's history. But when Pakistan goes to polls on 
Thursday 
– in what some critics warn may be the most 
unfree
 election to date – it is no hyperbole to say the stakes are enormously high.


Former Prime Minister 
Imran Khan
 languishes in jail as the authorities crack down on his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, while previously imprisoned and exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is back to contest the vote alongside an array of other 
candidates
 from the left to the right.
list of 3 items
list 1 of 3
list 2 of 3
list 3 of 3
end of list


However, the focus of this election is not only on addressing nearly two years of political instability but, crucially, on establishing a new, steadfast government that can stabilise an economy in crisis for Pakistan's 241 million people.


Some 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, inflation has skyrocketed to more than 30 percent, and according to a 
poll
 released this week, about 70 percent of Pakistanis believe economic conditions are worsening.


Last June, Pakistan faced the imminent threat of default, with foreign reserves plummeting to $4.4bn – barely covering a month's worth of imports – while the currency shed more than 50 percent of its value against the United States dollar.


As the country found itself at a precarious juncture, then-Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif managed to secure a crucial
 bailout package
 from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – its 23rd fund programme since 1958 – just weeks before the government's term expired.


The interim government, 
assuming power
 in August 2023, confronted the primary challenge of ensuring the continuity of the IMF programme, valued at $3bn.


Spanning nine months, this Standby Arrangement (SBA) IMF deal necessitated tough measures, including the elimination of subsidies on essential commodities, and allowing the rupee value to be determined by the open market.


With the current IMF programme concluding in March, just as the new government will take power, analysts emphasise that the winning party's first order of business must be to re-enter negotiations with the global lender to maintain stability.


Simultaneously, Pakistan faces a looming debt payment crisis, with the central bank reporting $24bn of external debt obligations due by June 2024.
 
‘Anti-populist' steps


The incoming government needs to negotiate with the IMF for a new programme, while also taking steps to reduce expenses and balance the budget deficit, Karachi-based economist Asad Sayeed emphasises.


'The government has to continue to take steps which are anti-populist in nature, subsidies on gas and petroleum cannot be resumed, exchange rate cannot be manipulated, and the focus should be to reduce expenses and balance the budget deficit,' Sayeed, who is a director at the research firm Collective for Social Science Research (CSSR), told Al Jazeera.


Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist associated with the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad (SDPI), urges the incoming government – regardless of its political affiliation – to prioritise economic decisions over political considerations and immediately engage with the IMF.


'The new government must keep politics separate from economics. They must avoid populism-driven decisions which were taken by some of its predecessors,' Javed told Al Jazeera.


The urgency conveyed by economists underscores the critical state of Pakistan's $340bn economy amid a volatile political landscape.


The recent history of economic challenges includes Pakistan entering a $6bn, 39-month-long IMF bailout programme in 2019.


In early 2022, then-Prime Minister Khan's decision to reduce 
fuel prices
 amid global spikes due to the Ukraine-Russia war violated IMF requirements, leading to challenges for the subsequent government.


Khan's government was deposed in April 2022, replaced by a coalition government formed under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) – an alliance that also includes Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) party.


In August 2022, the PDM government 
resumed
 the IMF programme but soon replaced the finance minister, Miftah Ismail, with a two-time former finance minister, Ishaq Dar.


However, economists have argued that Dar's attempts to control the exchange rate has had adverse effects on the economy, similar to the PTI government's decision to cut petrol prices.


Economist Sayeed said one of his concerns with the government of the PMLN – the frontrunners in the election – was if they bring back the same economic policies that were pushed by Dar, who is a senior member of the party.


'If the PMLN wins a simple majority and come in [to] power, they can end up taking steps which may derail the already delicately placed economy. You will again be teetering on the edge of a crisis and a potential default,' he said.

Tackling inflation


Additionally, the impact of inflation over the past year and a half is another pressing issue, which has led economists to underline the incoming government's need to recalibrate its priorities.


Islamabad-based economist Javed warned that the wrong policies could jeopardise the delicately balanced economy, potentially leading to a crisis and default.


'Tackling inflation and protecting people from side effects of stabilisation policies must be top priority,' he said.


'The people, particularly the poor, have suffered a lot. Prolonged higher inflation and unemployment have pushed many below the poverty line. They need to be supported.'


Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at Lahore University of Management Sciences, highlighted the enduring challenge of balance-of-payment crises throughout Pakistan's history.


'There is no decade in which we have not stumbled through a balance-of-payment crisis and suffered ‘sudden stops' in our economic management, accompanied by rapid, unplanned devaluations of the rupee and a painful spike in the costs of living,' he told Al Jazeera.


Highlighting the country's plight, Hasanain said Pakistan is required to pay nearly $90bn in external debt obligations in the next three years.


These liabilities require the country to repay more every year than what it received, $60bn, in China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment in a decade.


'The government badly needs a plan to tackle this fact. But since this appears almost certainly infeasible, we need to negotiate with our lenders, either through a restructuring of our debt, or through offering equity in Pakistani assets,' he added.
 
Fahd Ali, an assistant professor of economics from Lahore University of Management Sciences anticipated the incoming government struggling to align campaign promises with the reality of a sluggish economy.


'The party manifestos of leading parties promise lavish spending. This would be a tough promise to keep given that it is likely the new government will have to sign another three-year agreement with the IMF,' he told Al Jazeera.


Javed from SDPI underscored the need for any government to outline a plan for the first 100 days, with a focus on expanding the tax net. The tax-to-GDP ratio, currently at 10.4 percent, is among the lowest in the Asian region.


Economist Sayeed stressed the importance of policymakers helping the country move away from its longstanding 'consumption-based growth model'.


The latest Pakistan Economic Survey in June 2023 (
PDF
) revealed that consumption expenditure accounted for almost 94 percent of the country's GDP, while investment's share remained more than 13 percent.


However, Sayeed contended that the most imminent threats faced by Pakistan are the challenges and effect of climate change and climate-induced disasters.


Recalling the floods of '
biblical proportions
' just two years ago, he emphasised the need for significant investment in climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.


'Climate-related disasters are taking place every year and we need significant investment for climate mitigation and adaptation strategies and policies,' he said.


We have to seek investment in this sector, but for that, the issue itself needs to be recognised and acknowledged first.'

China's stockmarket nightmare is nowhere near over,The Economist,2024-02-07 17:35:54,full,https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/07/chinas-stockmarket-nightmare-is-nowhere-near-over,economist.com,The situation ought to worry Xi Jinping | Finance & economics,"R unning China's securities watchdog is a perilous job. A market rout can end your career, or worse. On February 7th, after weeks of stockmarket instability, Yi Huiman, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ), was suddenly fired and replaced. He is not the first official to fall after a period of plummeting stock prices. Liu Shiyu, his predecessor, was sacked in 2019, and later investigated for corruption. Xiao Gang, the boss before that, was treated as a scapegoat for the market crash in 2015.

Before his dismissal, Mr Yi would have been aware that he was on dangerous ground. Already this year, more than $1trn in market value has been wiped from exchanges in China and Hong Kong. On February 5th the Shanghai Composite plummeted to a five-year low. All told, the index is down by more than a fifth since early 2022. And as miserable as the performance of Chinese stocks has been for most of their three-decade history, the present downturn feels different.

That is because China's economic prospects are gloomier than at any point in recent history. The dire state of the property market is the chief problem. Prices and sales have fallen for more than a year; officials have failed to stop the correction. During the stock rout in 2015 retail investors had a slogan: 'Sell your stocks and buy real estate'. No one is chanting it now. Worse still, government rescue plans do not look up to the task.

For many citizens, it feels as if China never truly emerged from its dismal zero-covid years. An economic recovery that was expected to play out in 2023 faltered during the first half of the year. Pessimism has clouded the market ever since. Goldman Sachs, a bank, recently asked a dozen local clients—asset managers, insurers and private-equity types—to rate their bearishness towards China on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being equal to their outlook during the lockdowns of 2022. Half gave the country a score of zero; the other half said three.

The situation ought to worry Xi Jinping, the country's leader, for several reasons. One is that more than 200m Chinese people own stocks, and officials risk taking the blame for the downturn. Few things enrage Chinese social-media warriors more than a stockmarket rout. One recent post suggested that food deliveries to the Shanghai Stock Exchange were being searched for dangerous materials, such as bombs or poison. Many have piled onto the American embassy's social-media account to gripe. And a flurry of angry posts have been directed at Hu Xijin, a nationalist media personality who often tries to whip up support for Chinese shares. He said last year that he would jump off a building if he lost too much money on stocks—not because of the loss itself, but because of embarrassment. As the Shanghai Composite hit its five-year low on February 5th, some recommended that he keep his word.

Another reason for Mr Xi to worry is that markets reflect the perception of China and his leadership abroad. Until relatively recently global investors were in love with Chinese stocks. Their inclusion in MSCI 's flagship emerging-markets index in 2018 was welcomed by asset managers, and hailed as a step forward in attempts to make Chinese stockmarkets more international. Needless to say, the excitement has faded. Zero-covid policies hurt China's reputation. Mr Xi's support for Vladimir Putin despite his invasion of Ukraine has done further damage. But nothing, most investors agree, has harmed Mr Xi more than allowing the property downturn to drag on for years.

Although Chinese authorities still hope to attract investment, foreign investors are fleeing. They have been net sellers for months, dumping $2bn-worth of shares in January alone. The sell-off has been so severe that some experienced foreign investors are shutting down. Asia Genesis, a hedge fund in Singapore, announced in January that it would close its doors following the unexpected price drops.

Most foreign investors hold little hope for a recovery any time soon. One investment manager at a foreign bank in Shanghai suggests that the stockmarket may stabilise in the coming weeks. Indeed, on February 6th the CSI 300, a big index, finished the day up by more than 3%, its best performance in more than a year. Yet the low level of confidence will remain until leaders put forward a sufficiently ambitious plan to fix the property market. That might take years, the manager notes.

Money talks

Regulators have put out a series of statements about market stabilisation since late January. Most recently, on February 6th Central Huijin, the domestic arm of China's sovereign wealth fund, indicated that it would start buying shares to help stabilise the market. On February 4th the CSRC said that it would prevent abnormal movements in trading, while cracking down on 'malicious' short-selling. Such announcements have made fund managers uneasy. Foreign investors need to use hedging tools, like short-selling, to operate normally. Talk of a crackdown has therefore caused them to withdraw from Chinese markets in case they can no longer hedge positions. Some are also pulling back owing to fear that their staff could be detained and accused of financial crimes.

Both foreign and domestic investors are awaiting a state bail-out fund, about which there have been hints but nothing more. On January 23rd Bloomberg, a news service, reported that a stabilisation fund armed with some 2trn yuan ($280bn, or about 3% of China's stockmarket capitalisation) could start buying up shares. The 'national team', a handful of state-owned asset managers, which includes Central Huijin, often steps in during downturns. In 2015 it hoovered up about 6% of the entire market capitalisation through purchases of individual stocks.  recently, these investment firms have bought exchange-traded funds to avoid claims of insider-trading when the names of their targets leak. Although investors have seen signs of the national team at work in recent weeks, so far they have probably bought less than 100bn yuan-worth of shares—far below the amount required to produce a serious turnaround in the markets.

The central government may eventually step in with a bigger bail-out package, perhaps after the Chinese New Year holiday, which will shut markets for a week starting on February 12th. But Mr Xi is also eyeing sweeping reforms to how China's stockmarkets work and how investors value the companies that trade on them.

One part of the plan is to shift China's markets from a focus on capital-raising to one on helping investors preserve their wealth. The distinction often perplexes foreign market-watchers. Shouldn't stockmarkets serve both capital-hungry companies and regular investors? In theory, yes. But in China markets are different, since they often serve state objectives, too. In recent years, for instance, one of Mr Xi's main aims has been to open capital markets to industries such as artificial intelligence, green technology, robotics and semiconductors, as part of a push to compete with America and dominate a number of advanced-tech industries.

The government also wanted companies in these sectors to list within China rather than foreign exchanges, which led to the largest wave of initial public offerings ( IPO s) and follow-on issuance in Chinese history, turning the country into the world's biggest IPO market for several years. Chinese firms raised more capital on local stock exchanges between 2020 and 2023 than they did in the entire decade beforehand.

image: The Economist

This helped meet Mr Xi's aims. But it also drained liquidity from secondary markets, where investor value is stored. Firms often went public at high valuations only to see their share prices fall. Now regulators want to shift towards a more 'investor-oriented' market that protects average investors. That means fewer IPO s and more liquidity directed to secondary trading.

History repeats

China's markets have moved through such a cycle before. In 2012 regulators halted all IPO s in the hope that excess liquidity would support share prices. As a consequence no company went public in 2013, even as hundreds joined a queue to do so in the hope of raising funds. IPO s resumed in 2014. The following year the stockmarket launched into a historic rally that ended in a dramatic crash. The experience hurt the standing of both China's capital markets and its regulators. As officials try once again to make markets more friendly to investors, capital allocators will be supremely conscious of this experience.

Another part of the Chinese government's long-term plan is to raise the market value of state-owned enterprises ( SOE s). Although such companies already dominate China's markets, they are valued at just half the amount of similar non-state companies. This is because SOE s are viewed by investors as clunky operators that are more loyal to party apparatchiks than to shareholders. Policymakers have therefore proposed creating a 'valuation system with Chinese characteristics' in order to boost their share prices.

Such a system would aim to educate investors on the broader social roles, such as reducing unemployment during downturns, that state enterprises play. But it would also involve reforms within SOE s themselves. State managers have historically cared little about investor relations, and have not used return on equity as an internal metric for judging performance. This would change. Meanwhile, regulators want the firms to pay out regular dividends and conduct share buybacks that reward investors. If the reforms are successful they would not only increase prices on China's stock exchanges, they would boost the wealth of the state through its holdings in these companies.",economist.com,246,8,US,en,The Economist,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20240210_FND001.jpg,False,@TheEconomist,6.206662,33f3d954b4aa26252dd80919d02feb70,"['China Securities Regulatory Commission', 'stockmarket instability', 'market rout', 'stock prices', 'economic prospects', 'property market', 'stockmarket rout', 'stockmarket capitalisation', 'state-owned enterprises']","China's stock market is experiencing instability and a downturn, with more than $1 trillion in market value wiped out.

"ICC ‘turf war' blocking Ukrainian bid to have top Russians tried, advocate says",Patrick Wintour,2024-02-06 14:00:46,full,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/feb/06/icj-ukraine-russia-prosecutions-philippe-sands,theguardian.com,Philippe Sands KC backs Ukrainian call for an international tribunal to prosecute Kremlin leaders for crime of aggression,"The international criminal court is locked in a deplorable turf war that is blocking Ukraine's efforts to set up a special international tribunal with the authority to try Russia's leadership for the crime of aggression, Philippe Sands KC claims.

Sands, a leading advocate of an international tribunal, blamed Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, and some unnamed judges on the court, an international body based in The Hague that prosecutes people for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. He said they were opposing a special international tribunal not on the basis of principle, but a self-interested turf war.

Sands told a conference in London last week, attended by many Ukrainian ministers, that it was 'so sad the institution that seems most opposed to this idea is the ICC in the form of its prosecutor and some of its judges. This is not an issue of principle for them, but an issue of turf. It strikes me as deplorable that when a conflict rages on the territory of Europe, of the kind that has dragged on for two years and plainly could extend into a much bigger conflict, the idea that protecting your institution – turf – is driving your opposition is utterly appalling. It is a deplorable situation.'

Debate has been deadlocked for a year on whether it is politically feasible to persuade the UN to set up a special ad hoc international tribunal – separate from the ICC – to try the senior Russian leadership for the crime of aggression, or instead leave the task to a less authoritative court in Ukraine.

The delays have left Ukrainians hugely frustrated, and urging the UK to take a lead.

It is widely accepted that although the ICC can charge individuals for war crimes, it does not have jurisdiction over Russian crimes of aggression, since Russia is not a party to the Rome statute, the ICCs's founding treaty. The ICC is instead seeking to charge Vladimir Putin over the abduction of children.

Sands said some G7 countries – the US, UK and France – were nervous of an international tribunal since it might set a precedent that led to other world leaders being charged by other future tribunals.

So far, 40 different countries have joined the Ukraine core group that supported action on the crime of aggression, but there is no diplomatic consensus on the model of court.

Sands said: 'For this deadlock to continue, basically, is to assist only one side, and that is the Russian side. It reveals the west is divided and unable to act even on this issue.'

He urged everyone to seek a bridge between a purely Ukrainian and an international tribunal, arguing that far from minimising the role of the ICC, a special tribunal could accentuate and reinforce it.

'The nightmare scenario would be that in three four years' time a raft of junior people have been charged, but the people at the top table get off scot-free. The thing about the crime of aggression is direct and goes to the top table.' He said work had been done on an international tribunal but not in Ukraine, and not as part of the Ukrainian judicial system.

Fears remain that the UN general assembly, or security council, may not vote to establish the tribunal, reducing its international legitimacy. Russia, for instance, could veto any tribunal if the security council were asked to establish such a body.

But Frank Hoffmeister, head of the EU foreign affairs legal department, urged 'a dose of realism', about an alternative course of trying to set up the court through a vote of the UN general assembly.

He pointed out that although 140 states at the UN general assembly voted to condemn Russia's invasion as an act of aggression, support fell below 100 when countries had been asked to set up a register of damages in Ukraine caused by Russia.

He said 'I do not know how many votes you would get if you said ‘let us punish Putin'. If there is not enough support, the whole exercise is dead and it is a recipe for failure.'

An alternative is for the Council of Europe to establish the body through a multilateral treaty, but that would be an affirmation of the global south's exclusion from western-dominated international justice.

Sands was speaking at a conference in London where a succession of Ukrainian leaders lobbied for Britain to end its year-long prevarication and back an international tribunal, and not a hybrid model.

Andrii Smyrnov, deputy head of the office of the president, said international law is being held hostage by global politics. He said a purely Ukrainian model would probably be unable to overcome the immunity the Russian leadership would assert. He argued: 'Given its global influence and historic leadership of human rights issues, the UK can play a vital role in galvanising support for an international tribunal.'

Dr Anton Korynevych, ambassador at large in the Ukraine foreign ministry, said: 'A special tribunal on the crime of aggression goes to the primary root cause of the war crimes that started on our territory in February 2014. There is no existing court that can do that.'

He added that to gain greater political momentum behind the proposal, the discussion needed to be taken out of Europe to Latin America, Asia and Africa. 'In the end we need broad support,' he said.

Oksana Zolotaryova, director of the international law department at the Ukraine foreign ministry, said: 'What the people of Ukraine need is justice for what has happened throughout these 10 years. Every day we have a huge number of losses, civilian and military, and the people say they want those responsible put on trial. They don't care so much about money. They want to see the people like Putin who did it will first of all be in jail.

'They cannot wait for 30 years more for Putin and for the political and military leadership of the Russian federation to be found guilty of the crime of aggression.

Yes, we can charge Putin in the district court of Mykolayiv, but the war that Putin launched was not just against Ukraine, but the war was against the international order.

Israel's war on Gaza: Are boycotts hurting US brands?,Al Jazeera,2024-02-06 13:40:56,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/israels-war-on-gaza-are-boycotts-hurting-us-brands,aljazeera.com,McDonald's is the latest of several brands to report a sales dip in Asia and the Middle East.,"McDonald's is the latest of several brands to report a sales dip in Asia and the Middle East.

McDonald's has missed sales targets partly due to boycotts against its products in some parts of the world over its perceived support for Israel, the company says.

The war on Gaza 'meaningfully impacted' performance in the last quarter of 2023 in some regions, company officials said on Monday. Sales growth in the Middle East, China and India stood at 0.7 percent in the quarter, far below expectations.

The fast food company is only one of several United States brands hit by boycotts and protests over their perceived support for Israel's war on Gaza. On social media sites, lists are going around of brands accused of supporting Israel although the ties are often not clearly explained. The push is part of a larger Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign targeting Israel-friendly brands since 2005.

Here's a breakdown of how some brands say they've been hit so far:

McDonald's

Fast food giant McDonald's drew the ire of Israel's critics, especially in the Middle East, when its Israel branch gave thousands of free meals to Israeli troops in October, the month the country launched its bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza, which have now killed more than 27,000 people.

Since October, campaigners have called for a boycott of the company around the world. The impact has been more pronounced in the Middle East, where at least 5 percent of McDonald's franchises are registered. While the growth target for sales in the Middle East, India and China was set at 5.5 percent from October to December, the company achieved 0.7 percent growth — and likely saw its sales shrink in just the Middle East. Global sales grew by 3.4 percent in the same period, compared with 8.8 percent in the preceding quarter.

Franchises in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain and Turkey issued statements distancing themselves from the free food campaign in Israel and collectively pledged aid worth $3m to Gaza.

Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company is not expecting significant changes as long as the war persists. 'It's a human tragedy what's going on, and I think that does weigh on brands like ours,' he said.

Starbucks

Last week, coffee chain Starbucks slashed its annual sales forecast after a slump in growth. The company now expects full-year sales – globally and in the US – to grow from 4 percent to 6 percent, down from its previous range of 5 percent to 7 percent.

CEO Laxman Narasimhan told journalists that Starbucks saw a 'significant impact on traffic and sales' in the Middle East due to the war in Gaza. Sales also slowed in the US, where protesters have campaigned against the Seattle-based company, calling for it to take a stand against Israel.

Starbucks's troubles started after Starbucks Workers United, composed of thousands of baristas across more than 360 US cafes, showed support for Palestinians in a post on X days after the Gaza war broke out. The post was deleted less than an hour later.

Starbucks sued the union in an Iowa court for trademark infringement, asking the union to stop using its name and a similar logo. The post reflected 'support for Hamas' and had badly damaged the company's reputation, Starbucks said in the suit, adding that it had received more than 1,000 complaint calls. The company also said some of its cafes were vandalised.

The union countersued, asking a federal court in Pennsylvania to rule that it may continue to use the logo. It also accused Starbucks of defamation.

Both sides are engaged in ongoing, fraught negotiations on labour issues with the union demanding better pay and more consistent scheduling for workers.

Meanwhile, many people in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population, have been boycotting Starbucks and McDonald's since the start of the war.

Coca-Cola

The fizzy drinks manufacturer has long been caught in the crossfire of conflict in the Middle East. From 1967 to 1991, Coke was officially boycotted by the Arab League for building a bottling plant in Israel.

Now again, the brand's red logo is on lists of brands being circulated for boycotts on social media channels. The company does not appear to have set off any recent triggers, but its past affiliations with Israel as well as its reputation as an American company seem to be enough.

In November, Turkey's parliament voted to remove the drink from the shops and restaurants on its grounds. Coke's Turkey distributor reported a 22 percent drop in sales in the last quarter of 2023.

Meanwhile, in Egypt, the boycott of Coke and other American soft drinks has fuelled the revival of a 100-year-old local soda brand, Spiro Spathis, which has seen its sales surge.

Domino's

Domino's, a US-based pizza maker with franchises around the world, is also facing blowback. Social media posts said Domino's also gave free food to Israeli soldiers although there's no evidence to support the claims.

In Asia, the brand's same-store sales dipped by 8.9 percent in the second half of 2023, mainly because consumers in Malaysia associate it with the US, an Israeli ally, a company official said.

Malaysians have rallied in their thousands to call for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's office also announced in December that all Israeli-owned, Israeli-flagged or Israel-destined ships are banned from its docks. The country has no diplomatic ties with Israel.

'It's well publicised that American brands in Asia, and I largely talk to Malaysia in this case, have been affected by what's happening in the Middle East right now,' Don Meij, managing director for Domino's Pizza Enterprises, told analysts.",aljazeera.com,529,4,QA,en,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/201192211917393734_20.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675,False,,6.146303,b8abfff37e00f3eadabff91edc3fa679,"[""McDonald's"", 'sales dip', 'boycotts', 'Israel', 'Middle East']",McDonald's reports a sales dip in Asia and the Middle East due to boycotts over perceived support for Israel's war on Gaza.,Yes,"The article discusses the impact of boycotts on McDonald's sales in the Middle East and Asia, which is relevant to the NDA's focus on supply chain risks and potential impacts on jobs and skills in the workplace.",Yellow,"{

‘It's healthy to be on war alert': Sweden's conscription push gathers pace,Sara Kollberg,2024-02-07 12:46:35,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/its-healthy-to-be-on-war-alert-swedens-conscription-push-gathers-pace,aljazeera.com,"As it prepares to join NATO, Sweden's long-held neutrality will soon become a principle of the past.","Gotland, Sweden –
 Conscript Linus pokes his head out of the commander's hatch, eases himself through the opening, and lifts himself atop the tank.


Most of his days in the Swedish army are not so exciting, 'but today, when we are shooting, it's fun', he says, holding an automatic rifle in his arms.

end of list


At 18, he is part of a new generation of conscripts that is hoped to boost the armed forces and 
remilitarise Sweden
.


He is doing his service on Gotland, an island controlling the passage through the Baltic Sea, 275km (170 miles) from the Russian port of Kaliningrad.


Gotland represents the challenges facing Sweden as a whole.


The regiment here was disbanded militarily in 2005, when Russia was no longer seen as a threat. Now rearmament is taking place at pace, and the number of conscripts is tripling.

'This is a very special time in Swedish history, both for the nation and the armed forces, coming from neutrality and non-alliance, and then shifting towards collective defence within NATO. It's a big step,' said Colonel Dan Rasmussen, commander of the Gotland Regiment.


He cast the situation as a societal awakening that began with Russia's invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and finally the 2022 full-scale attack on Ukraine.


'We needed that final push to realise that it isn't getting better, and now we are preparing for the worst.'


Cold War-era military service was dropped in 2010 as the country drastically reduced its armed forces.


Its reintroduction in 2018 was accelerated by the war in Ukraine and Sweden's NATO application.


Conscription is up 30 percent this year, and the armed forces' budget is up by 28 percent – giving them another $2.5bn.


In early 2023, Bloomberg reported that Sweden plans to 
double the number of conscripts to 10,000 by 2030.


Earlier this year, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said at the National Conference of Defence that Sweden 'can't sit around investigating things year after year. Now it's important to get things done'.


Former NATO director of policy planning, Fabrice Pothier, agrees, saying Sweden went 'too far in neglecting Gotland'.


'It is healthy to be on war alert and war readiness footing rather than in denial.'


He said Sweden's neutrality in recent times has endangered the country.


However, a warning by Commander-in-Chief Michael Byden last month, that 'all Swedes should mentally prepare for war', stirred fears, especially among young people.


Kerstin Bergea, president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, thinks building up the military won't make the world safer [Sara Kollberg/Al Jazeera]


'Many young people and parents are calling us, worried that their kids will be sent to do conscription. ‘Will our kids have to fight for NATO? Are we in war?' That's the kind of questions they have,' said Kerstin Bergea, president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society.


'Even our own armed forces say the risk of a military attack on Sweden is low. So to have such a huge build-up isn't the right way to go. It doesn't make Sweden or the world safer.'


Behind conscript Linus another tank starts moving, muddying the ground on its way to the shooting field.


Linus explains he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and be conscripted, but not all who are called up do it by choice. About 10 percent are there against their will.


More than 100,000 teenagers born in 2006 are being sent their muster papers this year.


Caspar Sterling is one of them, now waiting to see if he will be called.


Petting the family's cat, he shows the forms he had to fill out on his laptop.


'It feels a bit scary that I might have to be away for nine months and not have a choice, risking going to jail if I don't obey,' he said.


'[But] it feels important to do this, to contribute during the situation that we have now,' he says, continuing: 'The fact that Russia has started a war again is scary.'


With Turkey having ratified Sweden's application to NATO, the Nordic country is now waiting for only Hungary to do the same before it can become a full member of the alliance.


Conscript Julia, a tank driver, trains on Gotland [Sara Kollberg/Al Jazeera]


Not everyone is happy with this new reality.


'Sweden will leave 200 years of peace and enter a nuclear weapon alliance, NATO,' said Bergea.


Back on Gotland, tank driver Julia, another conscript, stops to load up on more ammunition.


'With the worldwide situation of today, I think it's important,' she said.


She left home to live on Gotland for a year.


The island is usually known for long beaches and sunny days, but on this frigid February day, the harsh wind blows in from the sea as tanks fire live ammunition across the fields.


Few truly believe these weapons will be needed for real. But Sweden is not taking any chances.


In any case, these could be the last days of the country deciding its military direction – before NATO takes the reins.

‘This is a war on birth': how one US organization helps pregnant Gazans from afar,Adria R Walker,2024-02-07 12:00:46,full,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/gaza-pregnant-women-safe-birth-in-palestine-project,theguardian.com,"As the war worsens, Safe Birth in Palestine Project finds holes in the system to bring women aid – and tries to stay hopeful","‘‘I'm overdue.'
'I just delivered and I have no baby clothes or diapers for the baby.'
'I'm bleeding, I'm a pregnant woman.'
'I've been drinking salt water for three days straight.'
These are just a few of the messages that Ferhan Güloğlu, a co-founder of the group Safe Birth in Palestine Project, has received on the organization's Instagram account from women in Gaza. The group, which launched shortly after the 
Israel-Gaza war
 began, aims to provide long-distance medical care and advice to pregnant and postpartum women in the besieged region.
Thus far, Safe Birth in Palestine Project has provided Arabic language videos that give emergency unassisted birth instructions, and it is collaborating with local midwives on the development of an antenatal clinic. The group has also facilitated online consultations via Whatsapp between doctors who are members of the project and Gazan women. Additionally, it has shepherded some medical supplies, including necessary vitamins, to Egypt's border with the territory.
But reaching expecting and postpartum women in an increasingly isolated, war-torn territory has been difficult and dangerous. The group's co-founders have medical training and experience working in disaster areas, and even they have been shocked by the conditions in Gaza. Though Safe Birth in Palestine has managed to provide some desperately needed expert counsel remotely, effective medical care for pregnant and birthing women is simply impossible to deliver via teleconference.
'I have nothing to say to them,' Güloğlu said of the women who message her group on Instagram. 'There are pregnancy guidelines – the medical team is very well-versed in that. We are knowledgable in that. But health and nutrition are problems.'
The issues that Safe Birth in Palestine has encountered while trying to deliver aid give a glimpse into the extreme challenges that pregnant women, new mothers and children in the region are facing. As the crisis worsens, though, the group remains steadfast in its commitment to provide whatever care it can.
‘We were naive'
In the days following Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Güloğlu, a DC-based medical anthropologist who specializes in reproductive politics and childbirth in the Middle East, sought to mobilize her networks to help the people in Gaza. So when her former colleague, Sare Davutoğlu, an Istanbul-based gynecologist who has worked with birthing women in disaster areas, reached out, she immediately agreed to partner on Safe Birth in Palestine Project.
This crisis is especially targeting pregnant and postpartum women
Ferhan Güloğlu
Together, the founders connected with about 20 NGOs across the world that pledged to contribute aid and to work in solidarity. People in the US, Spain, Portugal, France and Turkey, after hearing about their efforts, reached out to ask how they could help. 'I emailed them saying: ‘Look, something is unfolding in front of our eyes. It's not just a huge humanitarian crisis, but this crisis is especially targeting pregnant and postpartum women,'' Güloğlu said. 'This is a war on birthing people, this is a war on birth.''
At the onset of the war, the UN estimated that there were more than 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, with more than 180 births occurring each day. There are few remaining hospitals in the area – Israeli forces have conducted airstrikes near and on hospitals directly, damaging buildings and making it hard to provide services. The hospitals that are still in operation are struggling with a lack of resources and fatigued staff.
Even before the conflict, due to Israeli blockages, many Palestinian doctors lacked access to specialized neonatal training and equipment, and faced 
shortages
 of other medical supplies. But just one month after Israel's bombardment began, doctors in Gaza were forced to perform 
caesarean sections
 without anesthesia. Some women are unable to 
deliver stillborn babies
, as medical staff are overwhelmed by emergency patients following airstrikes. Others have been discharged within hours of their caesareans due to the influx of patients. Without prenatal treatment, conditions like pre-eclampsia, a blood pressure condition that can be fatal if not treated, go undiagnosed. And when babies are born, they lack critical postnatal care and a clean, stable home.
Many Gazans are dying not just from bombardment, but also from starvation. 
Women
 who are breastfeeding, which is the main way to feed babies without access to formula, are advised to drink 16 cups of water a day, but finding clean water in Gaza is a major problem. For Safe Birth in Palestine, providing medical care to women who simply need sustenance has been one of its largest hurdles.
‘I am proud of my work': the women pushing boundaries in Gaza
'We were naive,' Güloğlu said. 'We were honestly hoping that there would be a safe corridor, safe zone for medical facilities … It's one of the worst crises, if not the worst, on women and children. In Afghanistan, hospitals were a safe space, but here it's not.'
Finding holes in the system
Given these dire conditions, Safe Birth in Palestine can't deliver the type of care it initially planned on contributing at the start of the war. The group has had to pivot and strategize about how to work within tight boundaries. It had aimed to send midwifery kits, Davutoğlu said, but was unable to include mobile ultrasound devices because the Israeli government said the metals in the devices could be used as weapons. It attempted to send medical kits, but they were blocked at the border. The organization's contacts on the ground said it might be more than a year before they are able to get the items into Gaza.
Despite these roadblocks, the group started a fundraising campaign with Doctors Worldwide, an organization that Davutoğlu co-founded that has been active in Gaza for over 15 years. Safe Birth in Palestine provided Doctors Worldwide with lists of materially necessary items for birthing people and, through the money raised, Doctors Worldwide was able to to procure the items and distribute them via its staff in Gaza.
The guidelines for what materials can enter Gaza are changed 'arbitrarily' by both the Egyptian and Israeli governments, according to Davutoğlu. She said safe Birth in Palestine was initially told that it would be able to send certain medical packages, but that they were turned away, meaning that medications that require specific containment, like insulin, expired. Current guidelines from the border governments stipulate that packages must be transparent, Davutoğlu said, and that they must email authorities ahead of time, informing what they are planning to send. Even so, she said, packages have been rejected at the border.
We had to find holes in the system to deliver the aid
Ferhan Güloğlu
'As the crisis unfolded, we had to strategize as we go and it proved much harder than we expected,' Güloğlu said. 'We are doing anything and everything that we can. So all these organizations we are in collaboration with ... We had to find holes in the system to deliver the aid.'
In late December and January, some 
British
 and 
US doctors were permitted
 into the strip. Members of Safe Birth in Palestine Project collected prenatal vitamins and other supplies for the doctors to take with them as they began to reach people who had been without treatment for more than 100 days.
Looking toward the future, the group recognizes that helping restore the medical system will require a long-term, dedicated team. Knowing the trauma that expectant women and their babies have experienced during the war, Davutoğlu and other members of the group who are trained in pregnant and perinatal psychology are already planning to provide specific psychological care once the war ends.
Güloğlu hosts weekly Zooms with doctors across the world to discuss the situation and prepare to help on the ground when more doctors are allowed to enter the region, perhaps following another ceasefire, the end of the war or during a medical delegation.
'We are not stopping after the ceasefire,' Güloğlu said. 'We are dedicated to this in the rebuilding stage.'
Hope in the face of hopelessness
About a month ago, Güloğlu was helping an expectant mother of five who was displaced to Khan Younis. The woman was concerned because she had stopped feeling the baby's movements. Güloğlu and the woman communicated via WhatsApp, but the woman lost internet access and was unable to reconnect for several days.
What amazes me the most about birth and about Palestinian resistance is the unyielding joy of it
Ferhan Güloğlu
'Birth doesn't wait. Pain doesn't wait,' Güloğlu said. 'Time is especially important. If you don't feel the baby, you need to take immediate steps, so blackouts during those moments are especially horrendous. The care is very time-sensitive.'
Eventually, they reconnected and the woman tried to send medical documents for doctors to review them, but another blackout prevented it. Güloğlu does not know what happened to the woman or the baby.
'It has been beyond our imagination, beyond our wildest nightmare,' Güloğlu said.
Despite the bleakness of the situation, the difficulty in accommodating changing rules and regulations, Güloğlu said that the resiliency and hopefulness of Palestinian people, in general, and of expectant women and mothers, specifically, motivates her to keep going. 'I got some messages saying, ‘thank you' from a pregnant woman in Gaza. She said: ‘I didn't think anybody cared, but now we know all these people that we never can meet in person – they do care.' I think bringing these organizations together specifically for childbirth is meaningful to them.'
And though they are living through war and 
genocide
, the birth of a new child remains a joyous occasion for women in Gaza.
'What amazes me the most about birth and about Palestinian resistance is the unyielding joy of it,' Güloğlu said.

Network blackout cuts communications for millions in war-torn Sudan,Al Jazeera,2024-02-07 16:03:59,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/network-blackout-cuts-communications-for-millions-in-war-torn-sudan,aljazeera.com,All three of Sudan's main internet providers are offline as the United Nations appeals for aid funds.,"Published On 7 Feb 2024
7 Feb 2024
All three of Sudan's main internet operators were offline on Wednesday, internet observatory NetBlocks has said, cutting communications for millions of people stuck in conflict zones or fleeing for their safety.


The network blackout could also freeze e-wallets that many people depend upon amid a widespread cash shortage.

A source from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary has denied responsibility, the Reuters news agency reported, and the companies have not publicly blamed anyone for the outages.


Two of the networks had been offline since Friday, when telecom sources and the army-aligned state news agency said the RSF had shut down the networks belonging to MTN Sudan and Sudani. Zain Sudan is now also offline, NetBlocks said.


Aid agencies have warned of rising hunger in Sudan and famine-like conditions in some areas, as a result of the nine-month war between the Sudanese army and paramilitary RSF.


The United Nations on Wednesday urged countries not to forget the civilians caught up in the war, 
appealing for $4.1bn
 to meet their humanitarian needs and support those who have fled to neighbouring countries.


Half of Sudan's population – around 25 million people – need humanitarian assistance and protection, while more than 1.5 million people have fled to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan, according to the UN.


In the launch of its joint appeal with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called for $2.7bn in funding to provide humanitarian aid for 14.7 million people.
 
The UN refugee agency asked for $1.4bn to support nearly 2.7 million people in five countries neighbouring Sudan as part of the appeal.


OCHA's appeal last year to provide aid to civilians in Sudan was less than half funded.


Aid talks?


Later on Wednesday, the UN aid chief said that Sudan's warring sides have agreed to meet in UN-mediated talks on enabling aid delivery.


Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland that he had been in contact with the heads of the two sides in the war about convening 'empowered representatives of the two militaries' to discuss aid access.


He said he wanted 'to get them to follow up the commitments of the so-called Jeddah Declaration', which the two sides signed last May, agreeing to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure and to let in badly needed aid.


Griffiths warned the lack of access remained 'very, very considerable'. While the Jeddah conference was organised by Saudi Arabia and the United States, Griffiths said 'this time it's the UN that will be the mediator'.


'I had positive responses from both sides,' he said, adding that he was 'still waiting for a confirmation on when and where', but that Switzerland had been suggested as a venue.


He said he hoped the meeting could take place 'face to face', but said plans were under way to organise a virtual call next week 'as a first step'.


Griffiths said the international community needed to act with a heightened sense of urgency.


'We must not forget Sudan,' he said. 'That's the simple message that I have to say today.'

Why Iran is hard to intimidate,The Economist,2024-02-06 19:40:33,full,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/06/why-iran-is-hard-to-intimidate,economist.com,US soldiers are a bull's eye target for Iranian militias,"D
ETERRENCE IS A
 simple concept: using the threat of force to stop an enemy from doing something. On paper, America should have no trouble restraining Iran thus. The former has a globe-striding army; the latter still relies on warships and fighter jets that predate the Moon landing. In practice, though, Iran has proved devilishly difficult to deter. It is hard to put off insurgents and militias through air campaigns; their goals are attrition and survival, not well-ordered governance, and they are willing to sustain casualties. Full-scale invasion is the only real way to deter them and the history of such interventions is salutary.
Since October the Islamic Republic's 
proxy militias
 in Syria and Iraq have carried out more than 160 attacks on American troops. Some were harmless—more theatre than threat—but not the one on January 28th, which killed three American soldiers at a base in north-eastern Jordan. The Houthis, meanwhile, an Iranian-backed militia in Yemen, have for months waged a campaign of missile and drone attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea, choking off a waterway that handles perhaps 30% of global container trade.
America has begun to hit back
. On February 3rd it bombed more than 85 targets in western Iraq and eastern Syria, the first round of what Joe Biden, the American president, promised would be a multi-stage response to the drone attack in Jordan. It struck the Houthis the next day and again on February 5th, part of a campaign against the group that has so far lasted a month. Yet the attacks from Iranian-backed militias continue, even after the strikes ostensibly meant to deter them.
Mr Biden's hawkish critics think they know why: American threats are not credible because America is unwilling to strike Iran itself. 'The Biden administration can take out all the Iranian proxies they like, but it will not deter Iranian aggression,' said Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina. Instead they call for direct attacks on Iranian territory; they point to the example of Operation Praying Mantis, during the 'tanker wars' of the 1980s, in which America sank five of Iran's warships and destroyed two of its oil platforms in the Persian Gulf.
Critics on the left make a different argument. They see talk of deterrence as misguided warmongering and instead offer what they say is a simple solution: end the war in Gaza. If Israel stops killing Palestinians, Iranian-backed militias might stop their own violent acts.
Both arguments miss the mark. It is true that hitting Iran's navy in 1988 compelled it to reduce its attacks on oil tankers (and stop targeting Americans altogether). But the Iran of 1988 was exhausted from a ruinous eight-year war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq and bereft of strong allies. It had no choice but to back down. The Iran of today, by contrast, has a powerful network of proxies and some degree of support from both Russia and China. A round of American strikes might make it even more inclined to use those proxies—and, perhaps, to dash for a nuclear bomb as insurance against future attacks.
As for the Gaza war, many of Iran's proxies do cite the conflict as justification for their acts. But history did not start on October 7th. Militias in Syria and Iraq have carried out dozens of attacks against American troops over the past decade. The Houthis, too, have a record of attacks on shipping. In 2018 they fired a missile at a Turkish cargo ship carrying wheat to Yemen; in 2019 they briefly seized two South Korean vessels. The war is merely an excuse to escalate what they were already doing.
America's struggle to deter Iran stems from deeper contradictions in its Middle East policy, namely its desire to pivot away from the region while simultaneously keeping troops in it, leaving a military presence big enough to present a menu of targets but too small actually to constrain Iran.
This reverse-Goldilocks arrangement had deadly consequences on January 28th. The drone attack in Jordan hit an outpost known as Tower 22, a logistics hub for nearby al-Tanf, a remote American garrison in Syria close to the tripartite border with Iraq and Jordan. Established during the campaign against Islamic State, no one can quite explain why al-Tanf still exists (one diplomat calls it a 'vestigial limb'). American officials cite a range of missions, from protecting a nearby refugee camp to monitoring Iranian supply lines into Syria. In practice, though, it mostly serves as a bull's eye for Iranian-backed groups whenever they want to lash out at America.
The Iranian regime views its proxies as vital for its survival: they are fighting a long war of attrition to drive American troops from the Middle East and hobble America's allies in Israel and the Gulf. Deterrence can only work if that perception changes. Air strikes telegraphed a week in advance will not do the trick, nor will parading aircraft-carriers and long-range bombers through the region, as America has done repeatedly in recent years.
Perhaps Iran could be dissuaded from using its proxies if it believed America was prepared to topple the regime of the Islamic Republic. After two decades of failed American adventures in the Middle East, though, neither Americans nor Iranians believe that. Even Donald Trump, who embodied Richard Nixon's 'madman theory' of foreign policy, stopped short of attacking Iran directly.
American allies in the region do not believe it either. A decade ago, Israel and some Gulf states might have cheered American strikes on Iranian proxies. Then as now, the region was ablaze: Iran was helping Bashar al-Assad turn Syria into a charnel house, and the Houthis were sweeping down from their northern redoubts to seize control of most of Yemen's population centres. A sustained campaign of American strikes might have changed the course of civil wars in both countries.
Today, though, those wars are basically settled—in favour of Iran's allies. The regime has its hooks deep in four Arab countries, and a few scattered sorties will not dislodge them. That is why Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both tried to improve their relations with Iran: if America cannot protect its partners, they reckon détente through diplomatic engagement and economic incentives is a safer alternative.
In a briefing with reporters after the strikes in Syria and Iraq, American officials made no mention of deterrence. Instead they talked of trying to 'degrade' the capabilities of Iranian-backed groups. That might be a more realistic goal: if America blows up enough Houthi anti-ship missiles, they will have to stop firing (at least until Iran can deliver more).
But that would require a prolonged campaign of the sort that Mr Biden may wish to avoid, which gets back to the crux of the problem. In the Middle East America is torn between leaving and staying and cannot decide what to do with the forces it still has in the region. The status quo is not working—and, paradoxically, it is Iran that has deterred America from changing it.

 (FPV), drones are 
transforming the war
 in Ukraine. Built from repurposed racing drones, they are laden with explosives and used like precision-guided missiles. They are cheap and have been used to disable tanks and other battlefield equipment and even to chase soldiers into dugouts. Both Russia and Ukraine are rapidly scaling up production of these drones and the technology is not standing still either. Both sides are looking to incorporate artificial intelligence into their drones so that they can better-recognise and attack targets, even when they have been cut off from their pilots. FPV drones will change how wars are fought everywhere. Runtime: 39 min

 to 
bolster US-Mexico border security and fund Ukraine's defence
 that had taken months to negotiate, but senators said they might 
still separately approve aid for Ukraine and Israel
, without tying it to the border crisis.
 
Ukraine has urged the west to speed up and increase deliveries of artillery shells after a 
Russian missile attack on Kyiv and other regions
 on Wednesday killed at least four in the capital and wounded more than 40. Officials said 
one person was also killed
 in the southern Mykolaiv region.
 
Leaked documents obtained by hackers
 are reported to reveal that 
Russia paid Iran $1.75bn in gold bullion weighing about two tonnes for thousands of the Shahed drones
 used to attack Ukraine. Based on the quantity ordered in the leaked documents, the deal 
worked out at $193,ooo each for 6,000 drones, 
with the balance made up by licensing fees for Russia to build its own, cheaper copies. A hacker group calling itself the Prana Network said it took the files from servers of the 
drones' Iranian manufacturer, Sahara Thunder
, the Telegraph reported.
 
The Ukrainian parliament passed at first reading a bill tightening army mobilisation rules 
aimed at allowing the government
 to draft more people
 as war with Russia nears its third year, lawmakers said.
 
'This is not the final decision. There will be a second reading, and changes will be made before it,' said Oleksiy Honcharenko, one of the lawmakers.
 
A 
major Chinese international bank has cut off some of its Russian clients
, reportedly fearing it could be 
caught up in sanctions over the Ukraine war, 
according to the Vedomosti business daily of Moscow. 
Zhejiang Chouzhou Commercial Bank
 is one of the main banks for Russian exporters. The paper said other banks had tightened compliance checks, hampering currency transfers in and out of China for Russian businesses. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the government was 'working' on addressing the problem with the Chinese government.
 
The 
Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
 in Russian-occupied Ukraine is 'relatively stable' with a reduction in shelling nearby, the UN's nuclear energy chief, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi, who visited the plant on Wednesday escorted by Russian soldiers, said he inspected water supply wells that had to be drilled after 
'the episode at the Nova Kakhovka dam'
. The dam, which supplied water to stop the nuclear reactors melting down, was blown up on 6 June 2023. The European parliament on 15 June 2023 
condemned the dam's destruction as a Russian war crime
.
 
Sources in the German government said it was examining the possibility of 
nationalising Russian oil company Rosneft's operations
 in Germany. Berlin took control of them following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
 
Germany is 
not big enough to make up the difference

real danger we currently face

The huts at Ripon Barracks are believed to be among the last of their kind
Ripon councillors have made a plea to save several historic military buildings from demolition.
A 1,300-home development, called Clotherholme, has been approved for the barracks site in North Yorkshire.
But questions have been raised over the future of seven military training huts and rare training bridges, some of which date back to World War One.
Developer Homes England said it remained committed to delivering a military heritage strategy.
Three barracks in Ripon are set to close by 2025 to make way for the development.
The historic buildings on the site include training huts that are believed to be among the last remaining of their kind in the country, according to the 
Local Democracy Reporting Service
.

Ripon councillor Barbara Brodigan voiced her concerns over the future of the military buildings
The plans put forward by Homes England were approved in early 2023, but Councillor Barbara Brodigan told a  meeting she believed the government housing agency was under no legal obligation to protect the structures from demolition.
The Ripon Military Heritage Trust, a registered charity, has also spearheaded efforts to save the buildings and has previously suggested they could be used to attract tourists to Ripon.
Councillors unanimously backed a proposal by Mrs Brodigan to write a letter to Homes England on behalf of the council calling for protection of the site's heritage assets.
The Liberal Democrat councillor said: ""The buildings don't just have historical significance but they could also be used by scouts and cadets and would be a huge benefit for Ripon.
""It can't be understated the significance of these buildings although unfortunately they're not listed.""
Mrs Brodigan went on to say the buildings were used in World War One and Two, as well as the Cold War.
""Just to take the buildings down and replace them with information boards around the site undervalues their significance,"" she added.
Councillor Pauline Hardy said that Homes England appeared to be listening but had got ""cotton wool in their ears"". 
A Homes England spokesperson said: ""We remain committed to delivering a military heritage strategy as part of our wider proposals for the site and continue to discuss options with the Local Planning Authority and the Ripon Military Heritage Trust.""

Tucker Carlson Interviews Putin: Here's What Led Here And The Pro-Russia Comments He's Made,Brian Bushard,2024-02-07 19:13:16,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/02/07/tucker-carlson-interviews-putin-heres-what-led-here-and-the-pro-russia-comments-hes-made/,forbes.com,"Tucker Carlson has repeatedly defended Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned military aid to Ukraine and argued Ukraine is not a democracy.","Topline

Following days of speculation, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Kremlin officials confirmed this week that Carlson has interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, a controversial one-on-one that will reportedly mark Putin's first time being interviewed by a western journalist since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago, though Carlson has routinely criticized Ukraine and praised Putin for years.

Timeline

2017Carlson questioned why Putin is perceived as 'such a bad guy' in the U.S., saying he's 'not Saddam Hussein, he's not Adolf Hitler,' arguing 'the Left sees Putin behind every problem and they're trying to convince us to see him too.'

November 2019Carlson said he was 'rooting for Russia' in its burgeoning conflict with Ukraine in an episode of his show, though he later clarified he was joking and really 'rooting for America.'

December 2019Carlson told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that the U.S. should 'probably take the side of Russia' in a potential dispute between Moscow and Ukraine, five years after Russia illegally annexed the Crimea peninsula.

February 2022Just weeks before Russia launched its invasion, Carlson argued Ukraine was 'not a democracy' by American terms, repeating claims Putin has made against Ukraine, with Carlson claiming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrested a political opponent and shut down opposition media outlets (Carlson appeared to be referencing the arrest of pro-Kremlin political leader Viktor Medvedchuk on treason charges in 2022, and the signing of a controversial law allowing the government to regulate media groups in December 2022).

Carlson also defended Putin on his then-top-rated Fox News primetime show, asking sarcastically if Putin has 'ever called [him]

a racist' or 'threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him,' saying the answer is a resounding no.

January 2023Carlson also repeatedly questioned rounds of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including during an episode of 'Tucker Carlson Tonight,' asking, 'where did the money go?' and baselessly claiming it 'went to Zelensky and his wife' (The U.S. has approved $75 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the start of the war).

April 2023Carlson speculated, without evidence, that the explosion of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline, which feeds Russian gas to Europe, could have been carried out with help from the U.S. government, a claim the Biden administration vehemently rejected.

In the week after Carlson was fired from Fox News, multiple Russian outlets appeared to attempt to lure in Carlson, with RT (formerly Russia Today) tweeting at Carlson to 'always question more with RT' and Russian outlet Channel One asking Carlson to 'come join us,' saying he does not 'have to be afraid of taking the piss out of Biden here'—Carlson later denied any partnership with Russian media.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov chimed in on Carlson's departure from Fox, calling his ousting 'curious news,' and arguing 'the wealth of views in the American information space has suffered as a result,' according to a CNN translation.

June 2023In an episode of his new show on X, formerly known as Twitter, Carlson described Zelensky—who is Jewish—as 'sweaty and rat-like,' a remark condemned by Jewish advocates, and claimed Zelensky is a 'persecutor of Christians' (Zelensky had signed a degree in 2022 to impose sanctions on religious organizations tied to Russia).

August 2023Carlson struck back at reports of Ukrainian resistance in Russia's war and indications that Russian troops were struggling in the ongoing war, arguing that 'by any actual reality-based measure, Vladimir Putin is not losing the war in Ukraine' but in fact winning and that 'Joe Biden looks at that and says we won't stop until you proffer an unconditional surrender.'

September 2023Carlson denied speculation of a collaboration with Russian state TV outlets on an agreement to broadcast his online show, calling reports 'Russia-related bulls**t' and 'absurd' after an ad for 'Tucker' TV appeared on Russian outlet Rossiya 24, with Carlson's representative Arthur Schwartz calling the report 'fake news.'

News Peg

Carlson confirmed his plans to interview Putin in a video posted on X on Tuesday afternoon, an interview the Kremlin also confirmed Wednesday, saying Carlson's views on Russia and Ukraine are not 'one-sided.' The former Fox News primetime host defended his decision to sit down with Putin, saying 'it's our job' to do so as journalists. Facing controversy over the interview, Carlson argued that 'most Americans are not informed' on the war and are 'paying for much of it in ways they might not fully yet perceive.'

What To Watch For

Carlson has not said when he plans to release his interview with Putin on social media, though he said on Tuesday that billionaire X owner Elon Musk promised him 'not to suppress or block' it once it's posted.

"Masked protesters could soon face arrest, says Home Office",Rajeev Syal,2024-02-08 00:00:02,date,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/08/masked-protesters-could-soon-face-arrest-says-home-office,theguardian.com,Rights groups say proposed police powers for England and Wales are pandering to ‘culture war nonsense',"Protesters who wear masks could face arrest, up to a month in jail and a £1,000 fine under proposed measures that human rights campaigners claim are pandering to 'culture war nonsense'.
Police in England and Wales will be given the power to arrest people if they are wearing face coverings at specific demonstrations, the 
Home Office
 has said.
Demonstrators will no longer be able to use the 
right to protest
 as a reasonable excuse if they commit public order offences such as serious disruption.
The move is in direct response to the 
four protesters
 being cleared of criminal damage after toppling a statute of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in 2022 . They successfully argued that they were exercising their rights to freedom of expression, thought and conscience.
Another new offence will make the possession of flares, fireworks and any other pyrotechnics at public processions and assemblies for protest illegal. Perpetrators may be forced to pay a £1,000 fine. It follows the use of flares and fireworks at protests against the Israel-Gaza war.
The changes will be added as amendments to the criminal justice bill. The bill is going through parliament and expected to become law by Easter.
Ministers will also make 
climbing on war memorials
 a specific public order offence, carrying a three-month sentence and a £1,000 fine. There have been recent incidents during which individuals have broken away from large protests and scaled national monuments.
Shami Chakrabarti, the human rights lawyer and peer, said: 'Should rape victims or refugees peacefully protesting really be punished for covering their faces to protect their identities? This is more culture war nonsense from the government while children go hungry and the planet burns.'
Akiko Hart, director of the rights advocacy group Liberty, said: 'Bringing in these powers put people at greater risk of being criminalised for exercising their right to protest – including disabled people who in some situations have only felt comfortable protesting in public when wearing face coverings.
'It is extremely concerning that the government is trying to impose even more conditions on not only when people can protest, but how they protest too.'
At present, if a section 60AA order of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 is in effect in a specific area, a police officer can demand that any item a person is wearing to conceal their identity is removed. Failure to comply can result in an arrest.
This had led to protesters removing their masks temporarily, disappearing into the crowd, and putting them on again, government sources said.
Under the proposals, police will be given the power to arrest people for wearing a face mask once a 60AA authorisation has been granted, sources said.
This could lead to police making a ban on masks an explicit condition before a march can go ahead, critics have said.
Protesters against regimes such as China and Iran have pointed out that the measure could prevent UK-based dissidents from organising demonstrations outside embassies. They claim their faces could be recorded and their relatives punished or disappeared in their home countries.
The home secretary, James Cleverly, said that recent protests had seen 'a small minority dedicated to causing damage and intimidating the law-abiding majority'.
'The right to protest is paramount in our county, but taking flares to marches to cause damage and disruption is not protest, it is dangerous,' he said. 'That is why we are giving police the powers to prevent any of this criminality on our streets.'
Labour welcomed the clampdown on fireworks and flares but remained cautious about the measures due to be introduced.
A spokesperson for the party said: 'We welcome a ban on flares and fireworks, which have been used to create disorder and intimidate police officers in recent months. We will scrutinise the details of these proposals to ensure that new measures are applied appropriately and proportionately.'
The Home Office said that since 7 October there had been more than 1,000 protests and vigils, with more than 26,000 police officer shifts assigned them between that date and 17 December alone, and 600 arrests.",Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Palestinian groups accuse UN adviser of failing to warn about potential genocide,Patrick Wintour,2024-02-08 07:00:05,full,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/08/palestinian-groups-accuse-un-adviser-of-failing-to-warn-about-potential-genocide,theguardian.com,Letter sent to UN raises concerns about Alice Wairimu Nderitu's ability to act with ‘effectiveness and impartiality',"Leading Palestinian human rights groups have accused the UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide of failing to fulfil her mandate after she issued only one statement on the war in Gaza – largely supportive of 
Israel
 – that has claimed 26,000 Palestinian lives.
In a statement issued in October, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, a Kenyan, omitted any criticism of Israel.
In a letter sent to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Wednesday, 16 Palestinian groups, including the umbrella body the Palestinian human rights council, said there had been a 'glaring absence of any action in response to the sustained mass atrocities endured by Palestinians in Gaza', and that this raised 'significant concerns about the special adviser's capability to execute her mandate with due effectiveness and impartiality'.
More broadly, the groups accused Nderitu of a dereliction of duty in failing to warn of a potential genocide, and said there had been a deafening failure by her to speak out about what had happened in Gaza.
For instance, she has made no comment on the international court of justice's 
interim ruling in January
 on a case brought against Israel by South Africa, which provided a strong indication that the judges believed there was a credible risk to Palestinians under the genocide convention.
The letter claims Nderitu and her office are not engaging with Palestinian groups, accusing her of cancelling planned meetings, refusing to respond to correspondence expressing concern and failing to attend official meetings within the UN building in New York at which the threat of genocide in Gaza is being discussed.
Given Nderitu's specific responsibilities at such a sensitive time, at a minimum her comparative silence is in stark contrast to other UN rapporteurs, who have frequently warned about how Israel has conducted its offensive.
The Palestinian groups said nine other UN special rapporteurs had highlighted the imminent risk of genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza in a statement on 19 October.
A further eight UN special rapporteurs expressed a conviction on 2 November that the Palestinian people faced a grave risk of genocide. Similarly on 16 November, 41 UN independent experts openly called upon the international community to take action to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.
The Palestinian groups said Nderitu had laid herself open to a charge of double standards by issuing a statement after an ICJ ruling on genocide in Ukraine but not commenting on January's interim Gaza ruling. The 'principles of genocide prevention must be universally applied, without making any special allowances or exceptions for anyone, including Israel', the groups wrote.
'The foundation of the special adviser's mandate is grounded in the lessons learned from past failure by the international community as a whole, including the UN, to undertake meaningful preventive efforts ahead of the genocide in Rwanda or Srebrenica.'
In her one statement on the Gaza war, Nderitu highlighted the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October and made no criticism of Israel, though she did say 'innocent civilians should never pay the price of a conflict for which they bear no responsibility'.
The formal task of the special adviser is to advance national and international initiatives to safeguard populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and the incitement thereof.
Israel's government has rejected accusations of genocidal behaviour in Gaza. Responding to the ICJ preliminary ruling in January, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: 'The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.'
Guterres and the UN as an institution have repeatedly been accused by Israel of anti-Israel bias.

U.S. Border Security And Ukraine Aid Addressed In New Senate Bill,Andy J. Semotiuk,2024-02-06 15:57:36,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/02/06/us-border-security-and-ukraine-aid--addressed-in-new-senate-bill/,forbes.com,"A new border/Ukraine bill in the Senate is being debated in Congress. As the New York Times says, 'Republicans will never get another border security deal this good.'","Senate negotiators recently unveiled the text of a bipartisan dea l proposed to address the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border and the need for aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Senate and House leaders have been negotiating the provisions for months in an attempt to find a way to adopt a deal. While many leaders have expressed reservations about the bill's provisions, suggesting various changes that are needed, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) warned on Monday, an open amendment process could turn into a free-for-all by allowing critical conservatives to delay a final vote indefinitely. Politico reports that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has vowed to hold a procedural vote to advance the package on Wednesday, although it's unclear if the legislation has the necessary 60 votes to clear the chamber. It reports further that the border-foreign aid deal faces even more difficult odds in the House.

Immigration Aspects

As for the immigration aspects of the bill, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) provided a summary of them as follows: 'This bill provides massive resources to the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS DHS ') and other agencies on the order of $20 billion, mostly targeted to the border. The bill creates new executive powers that will restrict and reduce the flow of migrants and asylum seekers at the southern border. If enacted, the border enforcement bill will accelerate asylum processing and rapidly expel many migrants from the United States. The bill also takes important first steps in expanding or affirming existing legal pathways to alleviate pressures that force people to the border.' In short, AILA says while far from perfect, it merits consideration.

In a video released recently online, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson asserts America is being invaded by illegal immigrants and the situation is growing into the destruction of the country. Republicans have made it a point to portray the incoming flood of undocumented immigrants as out of control and laid the blame on Biden's door. Former President Trump has called leaders in the Senate and the House discussing the border bill to urge them to block it because he wants to run on the immigration question as part of his Presidential campaign to regain the White House.

But anyone familiar with American immigration history will tell you that this problem has plagued American leaders for decades. The pure and simple reality is that it is not solvable through a partisan effort. As Trump's last Presidential term demonstrated, and Biden's current term is evident, the solution of the border issue is complex, difficult and imperfect. It is bigger than any one American political party. A national consensus is needed to resolve it. To draw an analogy, we are all in a sinking boat together. Calling our opponents idiots, incompetents and morons while delaying an imperfect bipartisan solution for a year so it can be taken up in a Presidential campaign or elsewhere is national suicide. There is no Messiah on the horizon. The cavalry is not coming to help us. We need these repairs, and we need them now. Yes, they are imperfect. But better them than nothing. Like it or not, that is the truth that both American political parties and their leaders must accept. As the New York Times put it, 'Republicans will never get another border security deal this good.'

Foreign Aid Aspects

As for the foreign aid aspects of the bill, it is no secret that Ukraine is running low on ammunition in its war with Russia and without urgent aid from the United States Ukraine could soon face its darkest hour. Indeed, on the Eastern Front the country is bracing for an all-out Russian attack reminiscent of former huge battles in World War II. Forbes summarized the growing conflict as follows: 'Five hundred tanks. More than 600 fighting vehicles. Hundreds of howitzers. Forty thousand troops. According to Ukraine's eastern command, Russia has assembled a huge field army in eastern Ukraine opposite the free Ukrainian city of Kupyansk.' And that is just one front in the war. It is increasingly clear Ukraine cannot succeed without more American firepower. Far from doing Ukraine a favor, this moment in America's history boils down to fulfilling its promise made to Ukraine in the Budapest Accords in December 1994 that America would support Ukraine's security, sovereignty and independence if Ukraine surrenders its arsenal of nuclear missiles, the world's third largest stockpile at that time, to Russia. Ukraine complied then to America's request and is now looking to America to comply with its promise. By way of analogy, this moment is similar to America's revolutionary war when it looked to France to get help to defeat Great Britain following the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

In an article in The American, Anne Applebaum provided a compact summary of where America stands at this moment. She wrote about the shock that would spread throughout Europe if Ukraine faltered in the war with Russia. She said, 'But an even deeper, broader shock wave would be triggered by the growing realization that the United States is not just an unreliable ally, but an unserious ally. A silly ally. Unlike the European Union, which collectively spends more money on Ukraine than Americans do but can't yet produce as many weapons, the U.S. still has ammunition and weapons to send. Now Washington is on the verge of refusing to do so, but not because the White House has had a change of heart.

'To the outside world, none of the logic behind any of these decisions makes sense. All they can see is that the American political system has been hijacked and rendered dysfunctional by a radical, pro-Russian faction led by Trump—a disgraced ex-president who used violence and deceit to try to remain in office.'

'By abandoning Ukraine in a fit of political incompetence, Americans will consent to the deaths of more Ukrainians and the further destruction of the country. We will convince millions of Europeans that we are untrustworthy. We will send a message to Russia and China too, reinforcing their frequently stated belief that the U.S. is a degenerate, dying power...' She concluded, 'But right now, the actions of just a few congressional Republicans could help stop a series of bad decisions from morphing into a worse one. This is their chance to make America serious again. Do they have the courage to take it?' It should be noted as well that in regard to Israel and Taiwan, the bill provides much needed funding to shore up their security in the face of threats to their existence as well.

Republicans Then And Now

Most recently, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has urged Congress to address the bipartisan border deal unveiled by Senate negotiators, telling lawmakers that 'we need this fix now.' It is unimaginable that any of the great Republican leaders of the past, leaders like Eisenhower, Reagan or the Bushes would have taken the position being taken by the MAGA House Republicans today. That is not because they are history, but because they were national leaders. And national leadership is at stake now. For the sake of the future of America and its leadership, let us hope that leaders in Congress seize this moment and adopt the bill they are reviewing both in regard to the border and in regard to Ukraine.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,9,US,en,Andy J.

Israel scorns America's unprecedented peace plan,The Economist,2024-02-07 21:32:56,full,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/07/israel-scorns-americas-unprecedented-peace-plan,economist.com,Arab states are offering remarkable 'security assurances' to Israel. But Bibi Netanyahu is defiant | Middle East & Africa,"I SRAEL'S TRIUMPH in the six-day war of 1967 was met by the infamous 'three nos' at an Arab summit in Khartoum: no peace with Israel, no recognition, no negotiations. The war in Gaza seems to be having the opposite effect, American officials say. Saudi Arabia, the most important Arab state, is saying yes to peace, negotiations and recognition of the Jewish state—if Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it occupied in 1967. There are perhaps two more yeses on offer: yes to Arab security assurances to Israel, over and beyond peaceful diplomatic relations; and yes to Arab states' help with reforming the autonomous Palestinian Authority ( PA ) so it is fit to take control of Gaza.

Such is the message carried to Israel this week by Antony Blinken, America's secretary of state, after criss-crossing the Arabian peninsula—his fifth regional tour since October 7th, when Hamas militants assaulted Israeli communities around Gaza, killing around 1,150 people and taking about 250 hostage. But to judge from the reaction of Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel is now the naysayer.

The outlook in the Middle East seems dire. Iran's allies in Lebanon are exchanging regular fire with Israel; and those in Syria, Iraq and Yemen are attacking American forces. Two days before Mr Blinken arrived, American strikes against Iran-backed proxy forces hit 85 targets in the region.  than 27,000 Palestinians are reported dead in Gaza after four months of war, with most of the territory's population being displaced, and facing disease and hunger. Israel stands accused of genocide in the International Court of Justice. In the eyes of many, America's reputation has also been stained by President Joe Biden's military and political support for Israel's quest to destroy Hamas.

Yet as he shuttled between marbled Arab palaces and Israel's humdrum political offices, Mr Blinken is seeking to turn the catastrophe of Gaza into an opportunity for peace. And American officials seemed elated by their talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto ruler, Muhammad bin Salman.

Once treated as a 'pariah', in the past words of Mr Biden, Saudi Arabia has become a central partner in America's ambitious diplomatic strategy. This involves securing an 'extended' pause in the fighting in Gaza with a hostage and prisoner exchange, perhaps leading in turn to a permanent ceasefire, Israeli acceptance of a Palestinian state, Saudi Arabia's recognition of Israel and new American security commitments. Mr Blinken seems convinced that, rather than 1967, the moment in Israel today is more akin to the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and the Palestinian intifada (uprising) of 1987-91. In these periods, the pain of conflict led, respectively, to the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and the Oslo accords of 1993 that created the PA .

Even so, the path to a regional deal is far from assured. For one thing the hostage agreement—the essential first step in America's plan—rests on a man whom the Israelis are determined to kill: Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Gaza in Hamas. He is thought to be hiding with hostages in the honeycomb of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza.

That said, Mr Blinken brought what he thought was hopeful news on this front. On February 6th the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, told him he had just received a response from Hamas to a hostage deal drafted by Israel, America, Egypt and Qatar. The answer was deemed 'positive' by Qatar, and flawed but workable by the Americans. But Mr Netanyahu dismissed it as 'delusional'.

If it comes off, there will be much bargaining over who will be released in what order. The big sticking point remains whether the fighting will continue after the pause, as Israel argues. Hamas insists on a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The likeliest compromise is a deal that will unfold in phases. America's hope is that even a temporary pause, ideally before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in early March, will help change the mindset of both sides, allowing them to think about the 'day after'.

All of which turns the spotlight on Mr Netanyahu, who has declared his intention to fight for 'absolute victory' and his opposition to any Palestinian state. Arab leaders want America to exert more pressure on him. For now, despite the growing public disagreement, the Biden administration thinks that halting the flow of weapons to Israel would only encourage Hamas and other members of Iran's 'axis of resistance'. Instead Mr Blinken stressed 'the importance of taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza' and admitting more humanitarian supplies. On February 1st America also imposed sanctions on four Jewish settlers accused of violence against Palestinians—something which Mr Netanyahu criticised as 'very problematic'.

Mr Blinken thinks the region is at a fork. One way lies salvation, with 'a very positive, powerful future' that 'genuinely integrates Israel into the region and addresses its most profound security needs', and also 'answers the aspirations of the Palestinian people'. The other way leads to damnation, with the fighting continuing in Gaza and an escalating war with Iran's allies. Though he did not spell it out, Mr Blinken seems worried about the prospect of Israeli forces pushing on to Rafah at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. Palestinians are increasingly concentrated there and the risk is of their being pushed across the border into Sinai. Seeking to reassure Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Mr Blinken expressed America's 'rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza'.

America is urging Israel to agree to 'a practical, timebound, irreversible path to a Palestinian state' as part of a four-sided deal between America, Israel, the PA and Saudi Arabia. America would offer a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia and civilian nuclear technology. The enfeebled PA would agree to reform.

To further sweeten the deal some Arab states are thinking of offering additional 'security assurances'‘ to Israel. These are as yet unspecified, though are unlikely to involve a formal defence treaty. Gulf states do not have large armies, nor do they want to be at the forefront of an American-Israel confrontation with Iran. But something looser might well be in the offing. Options include more intelligence-sharing and a robust common air-defence zone. Some even talk of joint military exercises, which would be unusual. Mr Blinken said these Arab states are 'prepared to do things with and for Israel that they were never prepared to do in the past'.

over Arab states seem ready to help the Palestinian Authority reform. Foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ), Qatar, Egypt and Jordan are set to meet PA officials in Riyadh on February 8th to discuss governance. Some Arab sources suggest Jordan could help train Palestinian security forces, and the UAE could help improve the PA 's administration.

Arab states have made clear they will not send peacekeeping troops to Gaza if and when the Israelis leave; nor will they pay to rebuild it unless there is an Israeli commitment to Palestinian statehood. Nevertheless, they seem to understand that they need to take greater charge of settling the age-old question of Palestine, or risk having Iran and other radicals exploit it to their advantage.

In private Mr Netanyahu is said to be more flexible than he lets on. Can he bring himself to say yes to the Saudis? And if he refuses, would those who replace him be more willing? Neither Mr Blinken nor anyone else is certain. ■",economist.com,246,7,US,en,The Economist,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20240210_MAP504.jpg,False,@TheEconomist,5.297398,0943b55064db032f6a9cde6497fceba5,"['Israel', 'Gaza', 'peace', 'negotiations', 'Palestinian state']","Saudi Arabia is offering peace, negotiations, and recognition of Israel if it agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

European politicians say Israel should be disqualified from Eurovision 2024,Priyanka Shankar,2024-02-06 14:54:38,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/israel-should-be-disqualified-from-eurovision-2024-european-politicians,aljazeera.com,Political figures pen angry letter to Eurovision organisers saying Israel should be excluded for its war in Gaza.,"The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are under increasing pressure to exclude Israel from this year's competition as it wages a war on Gaza.


More than 20 politicians wrote to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Tuesday saying Israel's participation in the contest 'whitewashes a regime that is carrying out ethnic cleansing in Palestine and committing war crimes and genocide'.

end of list


European Parliament members and politicians from Spain's left-wing Podemos party are among the signatories of the letter seen by Al Jazeera.


The annual contest is set to take place in May at Sweden's Malmo Arena after Swedish singer Loreen won last year.


The politicians behind the letter acknowledged that the EBU, which is a group of public media organisations, wants Eurovision to remain a non-political event.


'However, the Eurovision Song Contest did veto Russia's participation in the contest from 2022 in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Also, in 2019, Iceland was fined by the festival organisers because the Icelandic contestant displayed a Palestinian flag at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv,' they said.


'Israel's participation is in clear conflict with what the EBU claims to stand for, as it misinforms about Israel and conceals its genocidal behaviour,' they added.


Thirty-seven countries will participate this year.


Israel became the first non-European country to participate in 1973 and hosted the pop culture event in Tel Aviv in 2019. Entry to the contest is open to all members of the EBU.


Besides the European politicians, musicians in Sweden, artists in Finland, and protesters in Norway and Ireland have sent letters to the EBU urging public broadcasters to exclude Israel from the contest.


Iceland, meanwhile, is reconsidering its participation if Israel is allowed to compete this year.


At the time of publishing, the EBU had not responded to Al Jazeera's request for comment.




Israel accuses everyone of terrorism to continue massacring the Palestinian people with total impunity. We must prevent its participation in any international event that allows it to whitewash its barbarism, such as Eurovision.

‘Boycott Eurovision'


Eurovision, which began in 1956, is an international music pageant watched and adored by millions of viewers.


But this year, some fans said they will join protests against Israel by boycotting the contest and turning off their screens should it be allowed to participate.


'I'm a huge Eurovision fan. It should just be a bit of fun, but we all know behind the glitz and glamour, geopolitical games are at play,' Ciara Greene, a Belgium-based fan told Al Jazeera. 'The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, it was rightly excluded from the song contest. Allowing Israel to participate contributes to Israeli exceptionalism and normalises the state's genocidal policies.'


In Sweden, home to the 1974 Eurovision winner Abba, famous musicians like Robyn have also signed a letter calling out the competition's alleged double standard.


'It's hard to not be political with music,' said Ida, a 33-year old student in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. 'If Israel were to take part, I think most just wouldn't vote for them and make their displeasure known.'




Israel is reportedly planning to announce its entry on Tuesday.


Brian Donnelly, a human rights activist in Ireland, organised a campaign designed to pressure RTE, Ireland's representative broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest, into urging the EBU to disqualify Israel.


'We heard this strategy worked when Russia invaded Ukraine,  but in our case, we have not yet got a reply from RTE,' Donnelly told Al Jazeera. 'If Israel takes part, it will help their PR campaign of normalising what they're doing to the Palestinian people.'


Claire Charles, a marketing manager from France, said Israel's inclusion was a sign of 'Western hypocrisy'.


'All these public institutions are useless. Western governments are useless. Murder and occupation and war and genocide continues to happen,' she told Al Jazeera.


'Excluding Russia last time reveals the blatant racism of not excluding Israel this year.'

Humanitarian crisis in Gaza




Reports from the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA show that the Palestinian casualties in Gaza between Tuesday and Wednesday were 123, taking the total number of Palestinian casualties in Gaza to 27,708 as of Wednesday.


The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that a paramedic was killed and two others were injured after Israeli forces opened fire directly at them in an area between 
Ahli Arab Hospital
 and 
al-Shifa Hospital
 in Gaza City while on their way to evacuate the injured, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.


Israeli air attacks on two homes killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured many more in the Tal as-Sultan and Saudi neighbourhoods of Rafah in southern Gaza on Wednesday night, reported Wafa.


Additionally, two Palestinians were killed and 10 were injured in an Israeli air raid on a home in 
Deir el-Balah
 in central Gaza.


More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million population is now 
sheltering in Rafah
, where the original population was 250,000, according to a statement by UN humanitarian affairs chief Martin Griffiths on Wednesday.


The Palestinian Digital Rights Coalition sent letters to Meta, X, Telegram, and TikTok regarding the proliferation of hate speech, dehumanisation, and incitement to violence and genocide against the Palestinian people on their platforms, Wafa reported.


The coalition said the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice present a necessity to address the urgent need for online platforms to fulfil their legal and moral responsibility in upholding human rights.


The Israeli forces posted an excerpt from 
Herzi Halevi's
 situational assessment on Wednesday where he said bringing back Israeli captives was not possible without exerting military pressure.


 
Regional tensions and diplomacy




A US drone strike blew up a car in the Iraqi capital on Wednesday night, killing a high-ranking commander of the 
Kataib Hezbollah
, the United States military said on Wednesday, adding that the group is responsible for 'directly planning and participating in attacks' on American troops in the region.


The stabbing of a 23-year-old Palestinian American, Zacharia Doar, merits the label of a hate crime, Austin police announced on Wednesday. Bert James Baker, 36, was arrested following the Sunday evening attack.


Police in suburban Chicago arrested 33 people on Wednesday after they blocked streets for more than six hours outside a company, which, the protesters said, has a role in the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza.


US Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken
 warned Israel that it does not have 'a licence to dehumanise others', as Washington delivered one of its harshest critiques to date of Israel amid its war on Gaza. Blinken later posted on X reiterating his support for an independent Palestinian state.


US President Joe Biden is sending senior aides to 
Michigan
 on Thursday to meet Arab-American and Muslim leaders. The visit comes as Biden's handling of Israel's war on Gaza has 
frustrated members
 of the community in a key constituency for the 2024 presidential elections.

Occupied West Bank




Local sources reported that armed 
Israeli settlers
 attacked Palestinian shepherds and prevented their access to pastures south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday evening, reported Wafa.


Two Palestinian men were killed on Wednesday night by Israeli forces in the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem city, in the northern occupied West Bank. Israeli forces shelled a home belonging to one of the men killed using Anerga missiles, causing fire on the top floor, as bulldozers proceeded to demolish other parts of the house.


Wafa reported that a Palestinian man was wounded and another arrested during a large-scale incursion into the Wadi al-Fara area, south of Tubas governorate in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday.


Israeli forces again stormed Jenin on Wednesday, arresting five citizens and damaging infrastructure.

"US funding failure will have serious battlefield consequences, says Ukraine",Shaun Walker,2024-02-08 12:00:12,full,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/08/us-funding-failure-serious-battlefield-consequences-ukraine-war,theguardian.com,Zelenskiy aide says ‘foreign policy has become a hostage of internal politics' after Republicans torpedo aid bill,"The repeated failure of the Biden administration to get a 
funding package for Ukraine
 approved by the Senate will have real consequences in terms of lives on the battlefield and Kyiv's ability to hold off Russian forces on the frontline, say Ukrainian officials.
The latest move by Senate Republicans to torpedo a bipartisan bill that would have combined $60bn (£48bn) in aid for Ukraine with aid to Israel and increased border security measures is a bitter blow for Kyiv. It could signal a very grim year ahead as the US political agenda settles into an election year with 
Donald Trump
 all but certain to be the Republican candidate.
As the two-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale war in 
Ukraine
 approaches, Ukrainian officials say the delay in US support has already had a clear impact on the battlefield, where Kyiv's exhausted troops have a severe hardware deficit in comparison to the Russians.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy's aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Russian troops were using about 10,000 artillery shells a day along the length of the frontline while Ukrainian troops were restricted to using between 1,500 and 2,500 in response. He said the shortage of equipment made long-term planning impossible.
'If you have a clear understanding that in the next three to six months you'll have a particular number of long-distance missiles, for example, you can plan for which infrastructure targets to hit on the occupied territories. And when you sit here today with a deficit, and with uncertainty, you can only fight a defensive war, and this is a stimulant for Russia,' he said in an interview in Kyiv.
The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, expressed thinly veiled frustration with the stalling of the support package on Wednesday, noting there was a 
massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine
 overnight. 'There is no time to lose. Ukraine needs our security assistance now,' she 
wrote
 on X.
EU leaders last week managed to overcome longstanding opposition from Hungary's Viktor Orbán and approved a €50bn (£43bn) aid package for Ukraine. 'They are pleased, but it won't be enough without the Americans,' said a diplomatic source in Kyiv.
Yuriy Boyechko, the president of US-based aid organisation Hope for Ukraine, said: 'Everyone was hoping that US won't let us down, and now we find ourself at a very difficult place. People are losing hope little by little. We dont have time for this because we see what's going on at the front. The more time we give for the Russians to build up their stockpiles, even if the aid is going to show up it might be too little too late.'

Aware of the possibility that Trump could return to the presidency, Ukrainian officials are choosing their words carefully over the current standoff, but are undoubtedly frustrated by his actions potentially leaving Ukraine out in the cold. Zelenskiy has played an unwanted role in a domestic Trump-Biden conflict once before, with Trump's 
phone call to the Ukrainian president
 in 2019 prompting impeachment proceedings against the US president. Now, Ukraine is again in the middle of a domestic battle.
'We see very difficult elections, maybe one of the most conflictual elections ever and we see both sides staking out tough starting positions. Unfortunately, foreign policy has become a hostage of internal politics,' said Podolyak.
Ukraine has done its best to emphasise the importance of securing the aid. In December, 
Zelenskiy visited Washington
; his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, made a separate visit earlier that month and met Republican senators. However, so far it appears the arguments have not found a receptive audience.
'It's very frustrating; even when it comes to 
Republicans
 who were traditionally friends of Ukraine, classic Republicans. They know now that Trump has full control of the party and many of them are avoiding us,' said one source with knowledge of Ukraine's efforts to bring around Republicans.
The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Wednesday expressed bemusement at the ongoing saga in Congress. 'Last night I received the latest report from Washington on possible scenarios, and some of the scenarios are reminiscent of a thriller story. Everything is very confusing,' he said during a press conference.
Podolyak said he believed the discussion was far from over and Ukraine would keep explaining the stakes to US politicians. 'We have explained it, and we will explain it again and again. We just have to keep repeating the same truths: either the democratic countries continue to defend themselves, or they cede initiative to the others, and we are in a world where a war with genocidal elements is acceptable,' he said.",theguardian.com,60,5,GB,en,Shaun Walker,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21463a4846b4eaff8d9fe4c23ba29d2c5763ae37/0_419_5502_3300/master/5502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91f0bc2ca99a02e630dd69281ea01f6f,False,@guardian,5.106744,28704b1308483df9cd5f78886420c3df,"['Ukraine', 'funding package', 'Russian forces', 'US support', 'hardware deficit']","The failure of the Biden administration to get a funding package for Ukraine approved by the Senate will have consequences for Ukraine's ability to hold off Russian forces, as they face a severe hardware deficit.

Ukraine's Fortress City Held For A Decade. But Russia Was Willing To Trade Tens Of Thousands Of Lives For It.,David Axe,2024-02-07 22:15:25,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/07/ukraines-fortress-city-held-for-a-decade-but-russia-was-willing-to-trade-tens-of-thousands-of-lives-for-it/,forbes.com,"For 10 years, Ukrainian troops held out in Avdiivka, five miles north of occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. But now it's time to pull back, according to one analysis.","For 10 years since Russia first attacked Ukraine, Ukrainian troops held out in Avdiivka, a city with a pre-war population of 30,000 that lies just five miles northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.

But now it's time for the Ukrainians to pull back, according to one Ukrainian analysis group. 'The fall of Avdiivka is not a matter of if, but when,' Frontelligence Insight explained in a new report.

There are very few civilians left in Avdiivka's ruins, and rescuers are working to get them and their pets out of the city. Which is not to say Ukraine stands to lose nothing by pulling the army's 110th Mechanized Brigade —which has garrisoned Avdiivka since Russia widened its war on Ukraine 23 months ago—from the city.

There's propaganda value for both sides in either holding or taking Avdiivka. Russian president Vladimir Putin surely would enjoy the ruins as a gift ahead of his sham re-election next month.

But Avdiivka has actual military value, too. It's one of Russia's main objectives to fully control Donetsk Oblast—and to prevent Ukraine from ever liberating the oblast. That means eliminating pockets of resistance such as Avdiivka while also digging in and firming up local logistics.

From Avdiivka, Ukrainian troops can threaten the railways in Donetsk, forcing the Russians to find alternate—and less efficient—ways to ship people and materiel around eastern Ukraine.

If the survivors of the 110th Brigade's 2,000 troops quit Avdiivka and retreat to prepared positions several miles to the west, it becomes much harder for them and adjacent forces to hold at threat Russian supply lines threading through Donetsk. That in turn firms up Russia's occupation in the east.

All the same, it may be time. The 110th's troops have fought a valiant defense for four months straight, without a break, bleeding a 40,000-person Russian force for every yard the Russians gained. The Ukrainian army's 47th and 53rd Brigades have helped, by defending Avdiivka's flanks with drones, mines, artillery and—in the 47th's case—American-made M-2 fighting vehicles.

Since launching their latest campaign against Avdiikva back in October, the Russians likely have lost tens of thousands of troops, killed or maimed, as well as many hundreds of tanks and fighting vehicles. At times, it was possible the loss ratio—Russian casualties to Ukrainian ones—was seven-to-one or even 10-to-one in the Ukrainians' favor.

But that was earlier in the campaign, when the Ukrainians' supply lines into Avdiivka weren't threatened by incremental Russian advances along the city's flanks and, as of late January, Russian incursions directly into the city from the north and south.

Now the Russians are just a few hundred yards from the main roads into Avdiivka, and can strike Ukrainian supply trucks with handheld weapons.

It's a turning point. One Ukrainians veterans have observed before. In May last year, in a grinding battle not dissimilar to that in Avdiivka, a Ukrainian garrison held out for months in the ruins of Bakhmut. They killed as many as 10 Russians for ever person they lost—until the Russians traded blood for ground and pinched the city's supply lines.

Running low on ammunition, the Ukrainians in Bakhmut lost their advantage. 'Once Russian forces managed to seize Ukrainian flanks and disrupt supply routes, the casualty rates almost equaled,' Frontelligence recalled.

Waiting too long to retreat from Bakhmut, Ukrainian commanders partially surrendered their attrition advantage and—in the process—lost credibility with the Ukrainian public.

The lives the generals wasted at the end of the Bakhmut campaign still haunt Ukraine, according to Frontelligence. 'The reputation of certain Ukrainian generals has plummeted to the point where they are now likened to Russian counterparts, known for deploying careless frontal assaults.'

And that, in turn, has weighed on Kyiv's effort to mobilize hundreds of thousands of fresh recruits in order to sustain the war effort into its third—and likely fourth—year. 'The enthusiasm of people to voluntarily join the troops is waning,' Frontelligence warned.

If commanders quit Avdiivka before the Russians further close their pincers around the city, they could save hundreds of lives—and preserve their credibility.

A tactical retreat need not lead to a wider strategic loss. With the right weapons and—equally importantly— adequate ammunition, the Ukrainians could retreat from Avdiikva, consolidate their positions a few miles to the west and yet still strike Russian supply lines through Donetsk.

'Timely aid from the West is pivotal to avert crossing irreversible thresholds,' Frontelligence asserted. With more and better artillery and rocket-launchers as well as long-range aerial munitions and warplanes to launch them, Ukrainian forces could strike Russian supply lines from farther away and actually improve their situation in the east even after surrendering Avdiivka's ruins to the Russians.

The problem, of course, is that Russia-aligned Republicans in the U.S. Congress for four months now have refused to vote on $61 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine—aid that could pay for a lot of long-range firepower.

The Republicans' intransigence accelerated Avdiivka's likely fall by depriving the 110th Brigade of vital ammunition. These same Republicans can't resurrect the brigade's dead, but they at least could atone for betraying the defenders of Avdiivka by belatedly approving aid—and helping the Ukrainians to reposition for the ongoing fight.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,5,US,en,"David Axe,Forbes Staff","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3ff2e4a69e4a214fb0337/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,1125,x0,y139,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@daxe,4.9941225,61e504bf48c1f255daee0017d44691cf,"['Avdiivka', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'retreat', 'supply lines']","Ukrainian troops in Avdiivka are being advised to retreat due to the imminent fall of the city to Russian forces.

In the 1930's, Lt. Commander Delmar Farhney built radio-controlled anti-aircraft targets at the US Naval Research Laboratory. But Farhney – credited for being the first to use the word 'drone' for uncrewed aircraft – soon became convinced he could do far more. By 1941, he was demonstrating robot aircraft capable of accurately dropping torpedoes and depth charges. These were all 'third person view' drones operated from a distance like a radio-controlled model.

When war was declared, Farhney was tasked with producing an assault drone, with one of the technological wonders of the age: television. Dr. Vladimir Zworykin of RCA was one of the inventors of the television, and he was keen to put it to use for the war effort. A standard television camera or Iconoscope weighed over three hundred pounds, but Zworykin's team developed a miniaturized system including a transmitter the size of a carry-on suitcase and weighing just ninety-seven pounds.

The image quality was not great, and pictures could be hard to interpret on the monochrome green screen display, but it had a good resolution — 350 lines — and a refresh rate of 40 Hertz. The transmitter could beam back images several mile away, being basically limited to line of sight. The addition of television created the original first person view drones.

Farhney previously worked with obsolete aircraft converted for uncrewed operation, but now every available plane was being used for training or combat. The drones would need to be built from scratch – but without any of the resources that might be needed for other, more important aircraft.

The result was the TDR-1, made by Interstate Aircraft & Engineering, a masterpiece of plywood and improvisation. Some of the work was carried out by organ makers Wurlitzer, who had long experience at shaping plywood. The TDR-1 had a wingspan of forty-eight feet, a speed of almost a hundred and fifty miles per hour. Fitting a 2,000-pound bomb or torpedo beneath the fuselage was a challenge and the TDR-1 ended up with tail, ungainly tricycle landing gear.

Avengers Assemble

The drone was controlled from a modified Avenger torpedo bomber flying up to eight miles away. The Avenger had a crew of four, with pilot, radio operator, and gunner joined by a drone operator. The latter had a joystick, a television screen, and a rotary telephone dial which controlled the drones altitude and could release weapons by dialing specific numbers.

The drone operator had to work under a black cloth to see the green, five-inch screen clearly in daylight, but it gave a real sense of being inside the drone.

'To sit under the hood of an airplane and control the one up ahead with radar and television, where you can actually see where you are going – it felt like you are actually flying that plane,' said one operator.

The drones were tested against a derelict Japanese freighter off Guadalcanal, and the test was deemed a success - video here.

The STAG-1 drones successfully attacked anti-aircraft sites, gun positions, ships, and even a lighthouse.

'I distinctly remember the excitement, watching the grainy and sometimes static-filled green TV screen as the drone I was guiding approached the grounded ship,' said one operator. 'When an unfamiliar pattern of small dots began to appear, I thought the receiver was malfunctioning. Suddenly I realized; they were flak bursts! But I kept the drone on target, concentrating on holding its bouncing nose squarely on target. I crabbed it a bit to correct for wind and to avoid the worst of the flak. At the last second, I had a close-up view of the ship's deck. Then…just static. I had hit the ship squarely amidships.'

The majority of TDR attacks were carried out by crashing into the target, though the unit also experimented with conventional bombing. The Japanese supposedly called the TDR-1s 'American kamikazes,' but this is disputed, as the last TDR-1 mission took place before the first Japanese kamikaze attacks.

STAG-1 used 46 TDR drones in combat in September and October 1944. 5 were not able to locate the target due to television failures, 9 lost on the way to the target, 3 shot down by antiaircraft fire. Of the 29 reached their targets there were 7 confirmed hits, and 4 definite misses. The results of the other 18 were not known – the problem of any weapon striking beyond visual range – but the Navy believed that 11 hit at least the general area of the target and 7 missed.

Lt Commander Robert Jones commanding STAG-1 was proud of these results and believed they proved the value of assault drones. His unit was scoring precision strikes against targets, and could go in where air defenses were too heavy for manned aircraft. Casualties among dive bomber crews were extremely high, with some units losing 10% or more of their pilots per month. STAG-1 had achieved the same sort of success as conventional diver bombers without the loss of a single airman.

Jones believed that assault drones could play a vital part in the coming attack on Japan. Navy top brass did not agree; they did not want precision, they wanted massed formations of heavy bombers. After the drones were all expended, STAG-1 was reassigned. Jones watched unhappily as the thirty Avenger control planes were dumped overboard in Reynard Sound.

'The great broom of victory swept all new projects into the ashcan of forgotten dreams,' Farhney wrote in an unpublished history of the project.

The entire STAG-1 operation was classified and no details were published until decades after the war. This secret was one reason why the Navy was to rediscover and discard attack drones several times in Korean, Vietnam and afterwards.

80 Years On: Triumph Of The FPV

The modern FPV as seen in Ukraine has more in common with its 1944 predecessor than you might think. It is not just that this is use of new technology disapproved by traditional military commanders. Like the TDR-1, modern FPVs are essentially improvised and assembled from whatever is available. Like the TDR-1, the bomb slung under modern FPVs is awkward – they often take off from four bricks or an improvised stand.

And FPV pilots still have an immersive flight experience, though now it is done with VR-type goggles rather than a black cloth and a small screen. Control range is still basically limited to the line of sight, now aided by flying signal repeaters.

And the modern FPVs are extremely effective at destroying tanks, artillery, trucks and other targets.

This week President Zelensky announced the formation of a separate branch of the armed forces for drones, noting their importance: 'Repelling ground assaults is primarily the task of drones. The large-scale destruction of the occupiers and their equipment is also the domain of drones.'

North Korea ends all economic cooperation with South as ties hit new low,Al Jazeera,2024-02-08 07:46:09,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/north-korea-ends-all-economic-cooperation-with-south-as-ties-hit-new-low,aljazeera.com,"Relations have deteriorated as Pyongyang ramps up weapons development and Seoul bolsters ties with US, Japan.","Published On 8 Feb 2024
8 Feb 2024
North Korea's parliament has voted to abolish all economic cooperation agreements with South Korea as ties between the two neighbours sharply deteriorate.


The latest decision comes after Pyongyang last month declared 
Seoul its main enemy
, jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification, and threatened to occupy the South during war.

The Supreme People's Assembly, which takes formal steps to adopt policy allegedly dictated by the ruling Workers' Party, on Wednesday voted to scrap the law on inter-Korean economic cooperation, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Thursday.


Relations between the two Koreas
 have been in a deadlock, with key projects suspended for years, as Pyongyang ramps up its weapons development programmes and Seoul bolsters its military cooperation with the United States and Japan.


The assembly also abolished laws on the operation of the Mount Kumgang tourism project, which offered tours and was a symbol of economic cooperation between the two sides that began in the early 2000s, drawing nearly two million South Korean visitors. The resort was built by South Korea's Hyundai Asan.


The project was suspended in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot dead by North Korean guards for straying into a restricted zone.


The Mount Kumgang resort was once one of the two largest inter-Korean projects, along with the now-shuttered Kaesong industrial zone. During its peak, it housed the factories of 125 South Korean companies employing 55,000 North Korean workers.


Seoul pulled out of the venture – launched in the wake of a 2000 inter-Korean summit – in 2016 in response to a nuclear test and missile launches by the North, saying Kaesong profits were helping fund the provocations.
 
‘Not rational'


North Korea last year 
ended a military pact
 signed in 2018 to de-escalate tensions near the military border which was drawn up under a truce ending the 1950-53 Korean War.


South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday called Pyongyang's move 'an extraordinary change' but said it was hard to understand their logic.


'What hasn't changed is that the North has tried for more than 70 years to turn us into Communists, and while doing that, it realized its conventional weapons were insufficient so they went onto nuclear development to threaten us,' he said in an interview with state TV KBS.


Yoon said he was still open to engaging the North and would provide aid if needed, but added that the North Korean leadership is 'not a rational group'.


After years of border closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic, restarting its lucrative tourism business would offer the North a means of generating hard cash, but could now violate international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.

"$375,000",Eric Tegler,2024-02-07 05:28:51,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2024/02/07/375000the-sticker-price-for-an-iranian-shahed-drone/,forbes.com,A hacker group called the Prana Network broke into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) email servers and grabbed data on the sale of Shahed drones to Russia.,"A hacker group called the Prana Network broke into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) email servers and grabbed data on the sale of Shahed drones to Russia.

The group says it exfiltrated about 10 gigabytes of data from a company known as Sahara Thunder which acts as a front for the IRGC facilitating sales of Iranian arms to Russia. Iranian-supplied Shahed kamikaze drones have been a feature of the Ukraine War since Russia's 2022 invasion.

The UAV's designer and manufacturer is believed to be Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center, an Iranian firm likewise operating under the IGRC umbrella. Its delta-winged Shahed-131/136 variants are believed to have a range of approximately 500 to 900 miles.

According to an article published last Friday in the UK's Guardian newspaper citing an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the drones come with a cost of $20,000 or more.

But according to the internal Sahara Thunder documents seized and published by the Prana group two days after the Guardian piece, that estimate is well short of the mark. The documents show that a single Shahed costs $375,000 to produce. The hack also revealed that Russia and Iran negotiated a lower per unit price for a bulk buy.

An agreement conveyed in the documents set forth a price of $193,000 per Shahed for a 6,000 unit buy. A smaller order of 2,000 units would yield a $290,000 per Shaded sticker price. The two countries reportedly agreed to the larger buy, netting the Iranian government $1.8 billion from the sale after the addition of licensing fees.

The licensing fees cover local production of the drones in Russia. In January Russia announced that it had embarked on development of a less expensive version of the Shahed called the 'Hawk' to be made entirely from off the shelf commercial components.

According to an article in the state-controlled TASS, Hawk will have a range of about 217 miles (350 km) and will be able to carry high-explosive warheads with payload of 35 pounds (16 kg). Completion of flight testing and Hawk development is reportedly expected sometime in the first half of 2024.

If the hack has indeed pegged the per unit price of the Shaheds it shows that their bang-for-the-buck ratio, while still favorable, is not as dramatic as previously thought.

Their ability to disrupt operations and to damage targets from tanks to artillery in Ukraine varies with operational circumstances and the tactics used by Ukraine's forces but they remain generally effective from a cost standpoint. That efficacy may be measured by their rumored use in the recent attack on Tower 22 in Jordan and the deaths and injuries of U.S. military personnel.

The prospect of 6,000 Shaheds with which Russia could stage a mass attack on Ukraine's infrastructure is a disturbing one. If the country is able to produce the Hawk in numbers, it is still more concerning. A November report from the Washington DC-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) which analyzed satellite imagery of a plant in Yelabuga, Russia (500 miles east of Moscow) found that significant progress was being made in standing up Hawk production.

A firm called JSC Alabuga is identified as the producer and as of the November report, it was not found on public U.S. or allied sanctions lists. Analysts differ as to whether Russia can produce the licensed Shaheds at a cost of approximately $50,000 per copy as it claims but its capacity to increase local production of the drones was positively projected by the ISIS report.

That potential explains the additional chunk of funds Russia paid in the $1.8 billion it handed over to Iran. However, the state of Russia's economy and Iranian confidence in its ability to pay was likely reflected in the fact that some portion of the payments was provided in gold to Iran per the hacked documents.

If the cost information that Prana Network claims to have obtained is accurate, it represents a fascinating (if disturbing) insight into the lengths Russia is going to prosecute its war with cheap drones that aren't as cheap as previously thought.

It also shows that while the Pentagon waivers on executing its Replicator drone initiative, Russia has moved out.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,-1,US,en,Eric Tegler,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3095c3c52d41131290305/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@TeglerWrites,4.666564,229c24730ff0bf7b7f289050b8e71eac,"['Prana Network', 'Shahed drones', 'Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps', 'Russia', 'Sahara Thunder']","The Prana Network hacked into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' email servers and obtained data on the sale of Shahed drones to Russia, revealing that the cost of producing a single Shahed drone is $375,000, higher than previously estimated.

Why Democrats Could Sink Key Part Of Biden-Backed Israel Bill,Brian Bushard,2024-02-06 19:53:47,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/02/06/why-democrats-could-sink-key-part-of-biden-backed-israel-bill/,forbes.com,Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he plans to introduce an amendment to the $118 billion border bill to prevent the White House from passing Israel weapons deals without congressional approval.,"Topline

A group of Senate Democrats plan to restrict President Joe Biden from bypassing Congress to approve military aid for Israel, striking a provision in the hotly debated $118 billion border bill that would allow the White House to skirt congressional approval for weapons deals to Israel, as the House gears up for a vote this afternoon on a separate $17.6 billion standalone Israel bill.

Key Facts

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, said he plans to introduce the amendment Tuesday afternoon to the bipartisan border bill, a multi-billion dollar package that would provide foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine while overhauling U.S. border policy—a key demand of Republicans.

If approved, the amendment would strike a provision in the bill waiving the requirement for congressional approval for U.S. funding to Israel under the Foreign Military Financing Program.

While Biden has not spoken on the amendment, his administration bypassed Congress twice late last year to send more than a quarter of a billion dollars in military aid to Israel, with the State Department citing the 'urgency of Israel's defensive needs,' though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle questioned that decision, with a group of 19 members of Congress calling it 'essential for Congress to be able to conduct oversight of these arms transfers.'

Kaine, a second-term senator who was pulled into the national spotlight as Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate, said he has 'strongly supported' aid to Israel, but argued the proposed waiver removes a necessary check in U.S. foreign policy.

In a statement Tuesday morning, Kaine said he was introducing the amendment 'because Congress and the American taxpayer deserve to know when U.S. arms are transferred to any nation,' adding that no 'president of any party should bypass Congress on issues of war, peace, and diplomacy.'

The amendment comes as the recently unveiled border bill faces an uncertain future in Congress, with Democrats— including Biden—largely supporting it, but Republicans overwhelmingly objecting to it, with former President Donald Trump calling on lawmakers to vote against it in a move Democrats view as a political maneuver ahead of the November elections, with Trump dubbing the proposal as a 'gift to Democrats.'

Key Background

Congressional aid to Israel has been held up in tense negotiations for months, with lawmakers at loggerheads over additional funding to Ukraine and Republicans demanding tighter security measures at the U.S.-Mexico border. Biden asked Congress in October to pass a $105 billion emergency funding bill, including $14 billion in military aid to Israel and another $61 billion for Ukraine in its war with Russia. One month later, the House approved a $14.3 billion package for Israel, though Senate Democrats objected to the GOP-drafted bill on the grounds that it would redirect money earmarked for the IRS in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The bill never made it to the Senate floor. Following months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators introduced the $118 billion border bill, which would overhaul border policy by allowing the border to shut down if more than 5,000 migrants cross the border on a given day and making it more difficult for migrants to receive asylum in the U.S., in addition to providing military aid for Israel and Ukraine.

What To Watch For

The bill has been touted by Democrats, including Biden, but slammed by Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who proclaimed the bill was ' DEAD on arrival ' in the House.

Tangent

Republican leadership argued the bipartisan border bill provides unnecessary discretionary authority to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who Republicans are attempting to impeach over his handling of a surge of migrants at the southern border. Johnson separately introduced the standalone legislation Saturday, a bill that, if approved, would send $17.6 billion in military aid to Israel, though it requires a two-thirds vote in the House to pass and faces opposition from both parties.

Contra

Even if House Republicans' standalone Israel funding bill passes the Senate, Biden on Monday threatened to veto an aid package that does not secure funding for both Israel and Ukraine. Biden instead reiterated his push for the bipartisan border bill, saying his administration has 'spent months working' on the bill, which he argued 'secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel.' Biden also slammed the GOP standalone bill as 'another cynical political maneuver' after a group of GOP holdouts had demanded border security be included in a foreign aid package.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has decreed the creation of a separate branch of Ukraine's armed forces devoted to drones
. Zelenskiy has pointed to drone production domestically and with partner nations as strategically vital, and pledged Ukraine will produce a million in 2024. The commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in a comment for CNN last week that drones 'along with other types of advanced weapons' 
help Ukraine avoid being drawn into costly positional warfare
.
 
Frontline soldiers have little patience for rumours that Zelenskiy may soon fire Zaluzhnyi, according to the AFP news agency.
 'Replacing the commander during fighting, especially when they are so intense in our area, is not appropriate,' said an army medic with the callsign 'Beria'. Sergeant 'Luntik' said the issue was 
damaging morale and feeding 'all sorts of conspiracy theories'
. But troops said they would not stop fighting even if Zaluzhnyi is removed. 'Nothing will change. I will continue to carry out my tasks like I have until now,' said Vitaly, 32.
 
Nuclear power station staffing at the Zaporizhzhia plant is being cut to dangerous levels by the Russian occupiers, officials have warned
, as the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, prepares to visit it on Wednesday. Grossi said the plant was 
'operating with a very, very small number of operators'
. Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the Russians had locked out several hundred 'skilled and, most importantly, licensed [operators]. You can't just take them away.' Zaporizhzhia's radioactive fuel is also reaching the end of its useful life and potentially needs safe removal and storage. Grossi described the nuclear plant's state as 'very delicate'.
 
At the UN security council, the US and Russia have traded accusations over illegally supplied North Korean missiles being fired at Ukraine
 and the downing of a Russian military transport. 'To date, Russia has 
launched DPRK-supplied ballistic missiles against Ukraine on at least nine occasions
,' said Robert Wood, deputy US ambassador. Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said there was 'irrefutable evidence' a Patriot missile shot down a Russian air force Il-76 on 24 January. Russia claims it was carrying Ukrainian soldiers to a prisoner exchange but has produced no evidence to back this up.
 
Russia requested the security council meeting after it said Ukraine killed at least 28 people when it hit a bakery in Russian-controlled Lysychansk
, eastern Ukraine. Senior Ukrainian UN diplomat Serhii Dvornyk accused Russia of 
misusing the security council 'for disseminating fakes'
. Russia has admitted one of its senior occupation officials died in the bakery strike, while Ukrainian news outlets have reported the bakery was a supplier to the Russian side and a meeting place for Russian officials.
 
A former commander of Russia's Wagner mercenary group who fought in Ukraine and fled to Norway in 2023 has been denied asylum
 but will not be deported as it is too dangerous to send him back, his lawyer has said. Andrei Medvedev escaped Russia in January 2023 across its Arctic border with Norway.
 
The EU diplomacy chief, Josep Borrell, has visited a course for Ukrainian law enforcement personnel whose job it is to restore law and order in territories returned from Russian control
. It covers arresting dangerous residents as well as dealing with war crimes and mass graves. 'Discovering mass graves and then having to inform the relatives, this is not a joke, this is something that has to be done with adequate psychological capacities,' Borrell said.

Ransomware Payments Hit a Record $1.1 Billion in 2023,Condé Nast,2024-02-07 14:00:00,full,https://www.wired.com/story/ransomware-payments-2023-breaks-record/,wired.com,"After a slowdown in payments to ransomware gangs in 2022, last year saw total ransom payouts jump to their highest level yet, according to a new report from crypto-tracing firm Chainalysis.","Feb 7, 2024 9:00 AM
After a slowdown in payments to ransomware gangs in 2022, last year saw total ransom payouts jump to their highest level yet, according to a new report from crypto-tracing firm Chainalysis.

A year ago, there seemed to be a glimmer of hope in the cybersecurity industry's long-running war of attrition against 
ransomware
 gangs. Fewer corporate victims of those hackers, it seemed, had paid ransoms in 2022, and cybercriminals were earning less from their 
ruthless attacks
. Perhaps the cocktail of improved security measures, increased focus from law enforcement, 
international sanctions
 on the ransomware operators, and scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry could actually beat the ransomware scourge.
Well, no. That respite appears to have been a mere hiccup on ransomware's trajectory to become one of the world's most profitable, and perhaps 
the
 most disruptive, form of cybercrime. In fact, 2023 was its worst year ever.
On Wednesday, cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis 
published new numbers
 from its annual crime report showing that ransomware payments exceeded $1.1 billion in 2023, based on its tracking of those payments across blockchains. That's the highest number Chainalysis has measured for a single year, and nearly twice as much as the year before. Indeed, the company now describes 2022's relatively low $567 million in ransom payments as an 'anomaly,' as total extortion transactions have steadily grown since 2020 towards their current 10-figure record.
'It's like we've picked up right where we left off, the real onslaught during Covid in 2020 and 2021,' says Jackie Burns Koven, head of threat intelligence at Chainalysis. 'It feels very gloves-off.'
That record-breaking $1 billion-plus in extortion payments was a result, in part, of the sheer number of ransomware attacks in 2023. Cybersecurity firm Record Future counted 4,399 ransomware attacks last year, based on news reports and ransomware gangs' public listings of victims on their dark-web sites, a tactic the groups often use to pressure victims while threatening to release their stolen data. That's compared to just 2,581 total attacks in 2022 and 2,866 in 2021.
The spike in the number of attacks appears to have offset a more positive trend: By some counts, fewer victims of ransomware are paying the ransoms that hackers demand. According to 
data from the incident response firm Coveware
, which frequently negotiates with ransomware gangs on behalf of victims, only 29 percent of ransomware victims paid a ransom in the fourth quarter of 2023, a dramatic drop from payment rates between 70 percent and 80 percent for most of 2019 and 2020.
Even as fewer victims are paying, however, the total sum collected by ransomware gangs is nonetheless growing as more cybercriminals are drawn to a lucrative industry and carry out more attacks. Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, argues that the highly public nature of ransomware serves as a kind of advertising, constantly pulling in more opportunistic hackers, like sharks who smell blood in the water. 'Everybody 
sees
 all these ransomware attacks,' Liska says. 'Criminals tend to flock to where they see the money being made.'
Chainalysis notes that the record $1.1 billion in ransoms paid in 2023 was also driven by ransomware hackers demanding larger sums from victims, many of whom were carefully chosen for both their inability to tolerate a crippling attack and their ability to pay—what Chainalysis' Burns Koven calls 'big game hunting.' That resulted in close to 75 percent of ransomware payments' total value coming from transactions topping the $1 million mark in 2023, compared to just 60 percent in 2021.
Given ransomware's cutthroat evolution, 2022's dip in total payments now seems to represent a rare aberration. Chainalysis and other security firms explain that off year by pointing to the war in Ukraine—which disrupted Ukrainian ransomware operators, distracted Russian ones pulled into political hacking, and caused strife within ransomware groups with mixed loyalties—as well as international sanctions that dissuaded victims from paying ransoms and major law enforcement crackdowns.
In one case, for instance, the prolific ransomware group known as 
Conti
 disbanded after one of its leaders posted a statement in support of Russia's war in Ukraine and another dissented by leaking a 
vast trove of the group's internal communications
. Many of Conti's members then reformed under the brand of the Hive ransomware operation—which turned out to have been i
nfiltrated for months by the FBI and other agencies
 who were quietly stealing the group's decryption keys to foil hundreds of their extortion attempts. Chainalysis estimates that that sting alone likely prevented more than $200 million in ransomware payments. 'The dissolution of Conti was almost a perfect storm,' says Burns Koven.
Last year, by contrast, saw a perform storm of a very different kind: The Cl0p ransomware group 
exploited a vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer application
 to compromise thousands of victims, combing through them for the most high-value targets. Several were medical companies and government agencies holding millions of sensitive records. In total, at least 62 million people were affected, and Cl0p reaped more than $100 million from that mass exploitation, accounting for 45 percent of all ransom payments in June of 2023 and 39 percent in July by Chainalysis' count.
The continued growth of the ransomware business—whose disruption for victims, it should be noted, costs well beyond the $1.1 billion that some of them paid in 2023—may seem like a sign of failure for the continued crackdown on cryptocurrency crime: Since the beginning of the decade, regulators and law enforcement have been going after not just ransomware groups, but the rogue exchanges and 'mixers' that often serve as money laundering tools that allow cybercriminals to cash out their crypto profits.
Burns Koven argues, however, that even 2023's record-breaking ransom total doesn't mean the crypto crackdown isn't working. In fact, she says, it's driven ransomware groups to constantly seek new laundering methods and, in some cases, forced them to hold on to ransom payments for years before they attempt to cash out that dirty crypto, for fear that it will be frozen or seized. She adds that faster reporting to law enforcement from victims who pay ransoms—faster even than Chainalysis or other crypto-tracing firms can spot those payments on blockchains—could further aid in chasing down those funds and preventing them from being liquidated.
'The best way to bring these numbers down is to impact that laundering and cashing-out process,' says Burns Koven. Beyond even flashy law enforcement operations like the Hive takeover, she says that 'there's also operational friction and paralysis that contributes to stagnating some of their operations and ability to profit.'
For now, though, ransomware is looking anything but stagnant.

Gina Carano suing Disney and Lucasfilm over Mandalorian firing with help from Elon Musk,Benjamin Lee,2024-02-06 20:51:07,full,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/06/gina-carano-sues-disney-mandalorian,theguardian.com,"The actor, who was fired from the Star Wars show after ‘abhorrent' social media posts, is filing a lawsuit funded by the X owner","Gina Carano is suing Disney and Lucasfilm over her firing from TV show 
The Mandalorian
, with help from Elon Musk.
The MMA fighter turned actor, who played Cara Dune in the 
Star Wars
 series, was accused of 'denigrating people based on their cultural & religious identities' on social media in posts that were called 'abhorrent and unacceptable'.
Carano had used her online presence to share a post that implied that being a Republican is similar to being Jewish during Nazi Germany, ridicule mask-wearing during the worst days of Covid-19 and spread conspiracy theories over the 2020 election.
After a long-running fan campaign, she was 
removed from the show in 2021
 and later dropped by her agency UTA. 'The truth is I was being hunted down from everything I posted to every post I liked because I was not in line with the acceptable narrative of the time,' she 
wrote on Twitter/X
.
She claims to have used words 'not with aggression but with respect & the occasional comedy to keep the mood light in dark times'.
In a new complaint filed this week, Carano claims she was 'harassed and defamed' for having rightwing opinions and refusing to conform to those held by Disney and Lucasfilm. She also claims that her male co-stars were allowed to post derogatory statements about Republicans without punishment. Carano is claiming wrongful discharge and sexual discrimination, seeking $75,000 in damages and a court order that would reinstate her on the hit series.
The suit details that Carano was required by Disney to meet with a representative from LGBTQ+ group Glaad after online behaviour that was seen as anti-trans, yet she refused. She was then asked to meet with a group of LGBTQ+ Disney employees but again refused and was fired soon after.
The suit refers to Disney and Lucasfilm as using 'bullying, discriminatory, and retaliatory actions'.
In 2023, Musk had pledged to help anyone who had faced employment discrimination over what they posted on the platform. In a statement, the X's head of business operations, Joe Benarroch, said: 'As a sign of 
X
 Corp's commitment to free speech, we're proud to provide financial support for Gina Carano's lawsuit, empowering her to seek vindication of her free speech rights on X and the ability to work without bullying, harassment, or discrimination.'
Carano wrote that she has the 'deepest gratitude' for Musk assisting her in the case. 'I am grateful someone has come to my defense in such a powerful way & look forward to clearing my name,' she added.
Since her firing from the show, Carano has partnered with Ben Shapiro's rightwing site the Daily Wire to make the western Terror on the Prairie. She also starred alongside Laurence Fox in My Son Hunter, a Breitbart-distributed drama about Hunter Biden. She referred to Fox as one 'of my favourite humans'. Last month, Fox 
lost a libel battle
 after he called two gay men paedophiles on X.

UK tribunal says academic discriminated against due to anti-Zionist beliefs,Al Jazeera,2024-02-06 14:01:06,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/uk-tribunal-says-academic-discriminated-against-due-to-anti-zionist-beliefs,aljazeera.com,David Miller hails decision after tribunal rules he was unfairly and wrongfully dismissed by University of Bristol.,"Published On 6 Feb 2024
6 Feb 2024
A professor 
sacked by the University of Bristol
 after being accused of anti-Semitic comments says he feels vindicated after a United Kingdom tribunal ruled that he experienced discrimination based on his anti-Zionist beliefs and was wrongfully dismissed.


David Miller had been let go by the institution in late 2021 after a disciplinary hearing concluded that the academic 'did not meet the standards of behaviour' expected by university staff.
list of 3 items
list 1 of 3
list 2 of 3
list 3 of 3
end of list


The professor of political sociology launched employment tribunal proceedings claiming unfair dismissal, breach of contract and discrimination or victimisation on grounds of religion or belief.


At the conclusion of proceedings on Monday, Miller successfully claimed discrimination 'based on his philosophical belief that Zionism is inherently racist, imperialist, and colonial, a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010', said his legal representatives, Rahman Lowe.


'This judgment establishes for the first time ever that anti-Zionist beliefs are protected in the workplace,' the firm said.


Miller, who was also found to have been unfairly and wrongfully dismissed, said he was 'very proud' to have established that anti-Zionist views qualify as a protected belief.


'This was the most important reason for taking the case and I hope it will become a touchstone precedent in all the future battles that we face with the racist and genocidal ideology of Zionism and the movement to which it is attached,' Miller said.


'The determination that I was sacked for my anti-Zionist views is a huge vindication of my case all the way through this process,' he said.


'The University of Bristol maintained that I was sacked because Zionist students were offended by my various remarks, but it was plain from the evidence of its own witnesses that this was untrue, and it was the anti-Zionist nature of my comments which was the decisive factor,' he added.
 
A ‘landmark' case


Miller drew controversy during a lecture at the university in 2019, when he said the Zionist movement was one of five pillars driving Islamophobia in the UK, the tribunal heard.


The University of Bristol subsequently received a complaint from the Community Security Trust charity, which said his lecture was a 'false, vile … antisemitic slur'.


After an investigation of the complaint, no further action was taken against the Scottish-born academic.


But further complaints were made to the university about him after he took part in an event called 'Building the campaign for free speech' in February 2021, in which he spoke of being publicly criticised for his views on Palestine and Israel.


This led to the launch of disciplinary proceedings that culminated in his dismissal in October 2021.


Zillur Rahman, who represented Miller, hailed Monday's 'landmark case' saying it 'marks a pivotal moment in the history of our country for those who believe in upholding the rights of Palestinians,' Rahman said.


He added that the timing of the ruling will be welcomed by those facing persecution in their workplaces for speaking out against Israel's war in Gaza.


The University of Bristol said in a statement that it acknowledges the judgement of the tribunal but is 'disappointed with its findings'.

The Ridiculously Easy Way To Remove ChatGPT's Image Watermarks,Barry Collins,2024-02-07 10:34:56,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2024/02/07/the-ridiculously-easy-way-to-remove-chatgpts-image-watermarks/,forbes.com,"Following recent deepfake controversies involving Taylor Swift and others, OpenAI is adding watermarks to image metadata. But even ChatGPT admits they're simple to remove.","The watermark announcement comes amid renewed controversy over AI-generated 'deepfake' images. Only last week, X (formerly Twitter) was forced to temporarily prevent searches for Taylor Swift, after the service was flooded with explicit AI-generated images of the artist.

OpenAI announced that it is adding watermarks in image metadata—hidden code that accompanies each image—instead of making watermarks visible, as you often see with images from photo libraries such as Getty.

The company said it was adding the watermarks to 'indicate the image was generated through our API or ChatGPT.'

'We believe that adopting these methods for establishing provenance and encouraging users to recognize these signals are key to increasing the trustworthiness of digital information,' the company added in a blog post announcing the new feature, which will start to appear in images generated on mobile devices from next week.

However, as the company concedes in its own blog post, it's very simple to circumvent such a system.

Removing ChatGPT Watermarks

Images generated in ChatGPT will soon have metadata added using the C2PA system, which is an open standard used by many media organizations and camera manufacturers to embed data within images.

There's no immediate visual clue that an image is AI-generated, but images can be dragged into services such as Content Credentials Verify to have their provenance checked.

Here, for example, I dragged an image I created with ChatGPT into Content Credentials Verify, and it revealed the image was generated by the AI service. Even though the new metadata system is yet to be rolled out, ChatGPT-generated images already contain a metadata link back to ChatGPT, allowing them to be identified by such services.

However, simply taking a screenshot of the exact same image is enough to remove the identifying metadata and leave services such as Content Credentials Verify unable to identify whether an image is AI-generated or not.

And even if you don't want to use the screenshot method, there are other simple means to remove the metadata, as ChatGPT itself explains:

In OpenAI's defense, and as ChatGPT explains itself, there are legitimate privacy and security reasons why you might want to remove image metadata. Whistleblowers or reporters sending images from war zones might want to remove data that might betray their precise location, for example. Or parents might not want location-based data when sharing photos of their children.

Nevertheless, it's a trivial task to remove the data that identifies an image as AI-generated. 'Metadata like C2PA is not a silver bullet to address issues of provenance,' OpenAI admits in its blog post.

'It can easily be removed either accidentally or intentionally. For example, most social media platforms today remove metadata from uploaded images, and actions like taking a screenshot can also remove it. Therefore, an image lacking this metadata may or may not have been generated with ChatGPT or our API.'

Despite the ease with which it can be circumvented, the company believes that 'adopting these methods for establishing provenance and encouraging users to recognize these signals are key to increasing the trustworthiness of digital information.'

The C2PA metadata being inserted into images won't be used for other types of content generated by the AI service, including text and audio.

AI Deepfake Fears

OpenAI's attempts to improve the detection of AI images comes amid growing fears about AI's ability to wreak havoc in a number of scenarios.

Schools are already using a variety of other (imperfect) methods to detect if content has been written by students or AI, including looking for telltale keywords.

With elections scheduled for many Western democracies in 2024, there are increasing fears that faked AI-generated images and videos could interfere with the campaigns.

Taylor Swift was once again involved in a deepfake controversy this week, when a video appearing to show the musician holding a flag promoting Donald Trump went viral on social media. The video was proven to be fake.

AI-generated deepfakes are also being used to commit crimes. This week, it was reported that fraudsters used a deepfake video to convince a finance worker that they were speaking with their chief financial officer on a video call, resulting in the theft of $25 million.",forbes.com,49,1,US,en,"Barry Collins,Senior Contributor","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c35b7d1f17541f8e6d4b8a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3251,1827,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@bazzacollins,3.5522017,277d976330d67013a18ed2648a55ea04,"['AI-generated images', 'watermarks', 'provenance', 'metadata', 'deepfakes']","OpenAI is adding watermarks to AI-generated images to establish provenance and increase trustworthiness, but it is acknowledged that the system can be easily circumvented.

France Has Extra Mirage Fighter-Bombers. Ukraine Wants Them. A Deal Is Possible.,David Axe,2024-02-06 23:47:41,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/06/france-has-extra-mirage-fighter-bombers-ukraine-wants-them-a-deal-is-possible/,forbes.com,It's obvious why Ukraine would want the French air force's leftover Mirage 2000Ds. The Mirages are compatible with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer smart bombs.,"It's not for no reason that rumors continue to swirl around France, Ukraine and the Dassault Mirage 2000D fighter-bomber.

Ukraine needs warplanes. France is retiring some of its delta-wing Mirage 2000Ds. And the French government already has pledged to Ukraine the Mirage's best precision-guided munitions.

If France indeed is going to donate Mirages, the announcement could come soon. French president Emmanuel Macron is set to visit Ukraine this month.

It's obvious why Ukraine would want some of the French air force's leftover Mirage 2000Ds. The two-seat, single-engine, supersonic Mirages fully are compatible with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer smart bombs. The former already is in use in Ukraine; the latter is coming soon.

The French air force acquired 86 Mirage 2000Ds from manufacturer Dassault and, after three decades of hard use during which several of the jets crashed, opted to upgrade 55 of the jets for service through the 2030s. That leaves around 20 of the planes that are surplus to France's needs.

Ukrainian officials have been eyeing the type even as they work with Danish, Dutch and Norwegian officials to acquire score of surplus European Lockheed Martin F-16s —and get Ukrainian pilots qualified on the single-seat fighters in the United States and Romania.

'It is possible that the combat capabilities of Su-24M bombers will be enhanced by Mirage 2000D,' commander of the Ukrainian air force Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk wrote last month.

Oleshchuk isn't wrong to link the French fighter to his air force's existing Sukhoi Su-24M bombers. The swing-wing Sukhois are the Ukrainian air force's primary long-range strike planes.

Firing British-made Storm Shadow and French SCALP cruise missiles out to a range of around 200 miles, the Su-24s have blown up Russian navy warships, pummeled Russian air bases, dropped bridges in Russian-occupied territories and flattened Russian headquarters.

France gave Ukraine around 50 of the 2,900-pound SCALPs in 2023 and recently pledged another 40. The United Kingdom meanwhile has donated an unspecified number of similar Storm Shadows—likely dozens of copies.

The Ukrainians are running low on bombers, however. The air force's sole Su-24M unit, the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Starokostiantyniv in western Ukraine, went to war in February 2022 with probably two dozen Sukhois. In 23 months of hard fighting, according to Oryx, it has lost 18 of the bombers.

While it's possible Ukrainian technicians could bring back to flyable status some of the dozens of derelict Su-24s that had been moldering in open storage at various airplane boneyards across Ukraine, there's another way to restore the 7th Brigade's front-line strength: give it Mirage 2000Ds.

Yes, the French jets would require new logistical infrastructure. Yes, the Sukhoi crews might have to spend months qualifying on the Mirages. The investment could be worth it, however.

For one, it's increasingly unlikely Ukraine ever will get surplus warplanes from the United States. Russia-aligned Republicans in the U.S. Congress for months have blocked further aid to Ukraine. If the Ukrainian air force is going to rearm, it must do so with European planes.

Moreover, the Mirages could reach Ukraine shortly after Ukraine also receives a large consignment—hundreds, according to Macron—of Hammer rocket-boosted bombs, each ranging as far as 34 miles.

The Hammers, which come in 276-, 1,100- and 2,200-pound versions with a variety of seeker options. They're comparable to the Joint Direct Attack Munition glide-bombs the United States gave to Ukraine before Republicans cut off aid, and which the Ukrainians have fitted to their old Mikoyan MiG-29 fighters.

Where it takes time and effort to integrate a new Western munition on a Soviet-made Sukhoi or MiG warplane, the Mirage 2000D has been compatible with the Hammer bombs since the munitions debuted in French service in 2007.",forbes.com,49,5,US,en,"David Axe,Forbes Staff","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c2c3d3043e5bd47ad538ea/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1400,788,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@forbes,3.529733,3213c4c65811c32c85b2d8dc1703aaaf,"['Ukraine', 'France', 'Mirage 2000D', 'warplanes', 'SCALP-EG cruise missiles', 'Hammer smart bombs', 'Su-24M bombers', 'Storm Shadow cruise missiles', 'logistical infrastructure', 'European planes', 'Hammer rocket-boosted bombs']","France may donate surplus Mirage 2000D fighter-bombers to Ukraine, which would enhance Ukraine's combat capabilities.

US Senate voting on border bill tied to Ukraine and Israel aid,,2024-02-07 20:00:00,timezone unknown,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-us-canada-68221877,bbc.co.uk,Donald Trump has urged Republicans to vote against the $118bn package because he says it's not tough enough.,"With 41 votes cast against the measure, the bill now appears to be doomed. 
To advance, it would have needed 60 senators from the 100-member body to vote ""yes"". 
Mathematically, that is no longer possible. 
The result, however, is not official until the gavel is struck, as senators could, theoretically, change their minds. 
We're nearing the end of the voting process - and the ""no"" votes have quickly caught up to the ""yes"" votes, as more Republicans vote against advancing the bill. 
As things stand, 47 senators have voted to advance the bill, while 37 have voted against it.

More than half the conference has now voted - and we've had several Democrats voting no.
Elizabeth Warren, Alex Padilla and Bob Menendez are voting against the bill because they do not agree with its border reforms.
Ed Markey, another progressive, has also voted no.
Progressive Independent Bernie Sanders has also voted against the measure, as he opposes unconditional funding for Israel's war in Gaza.
Republican Lisa Murkowski, a yes vote, has meanwhile popped up to the press gallery, where she is deep in conversation with the New York Times' chief political correspondent. 
I'm not entirely sure she is meant to be up here, just as we are not meant to be in the chamber.

The votes are still slowly coming through, it's currently
 36 in favour 
and 
14 against.
So while that's going on, let's quickly look at Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, who is facing growing dissention from fellow party members for his work negotiating the bill. 
McConnell, 82, had previously embraced the bill and has been a vocal advocate of additional assistance for Ukraine. 
Among those who have criticised his handling of the negotiations and subsequent bill is Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who yesterday called on McConnell to step down. 
""I think a Republican leader should actually lead this conference and should advance the priorities of Republicans,"" Cruz said. 
In his remarks on Tuesday, Cruz said that the bill was ""designed to lose"". 
Other Senators that have voiced their opposition to McConnell include Florida Republican Rick Scott, Ohio Senator JD Vance and Missouri Republican Eric Schmitt. 
Votes are still coming in - slowly, as you can probably tell by now. 
It's a very subdued scene, with just a few senators on the floor at any given time as others trickle in to cast their votes. 
So far, 31 senators have voted ""yes"" to advance the bill, and 11 have voted ""no"". 
To advance, the motion will need another 29 votes. 
So far, 26 people have voted to advance the bill. 
Six have voted no. 
The bill needs 60 votes to advance. 
The Senate is voting on the $118bn border security and foreign aid bill.

Don't come to Arizona: Senator to those politicising border issue
Senator Kyrsten Sinema, from Arizona, has just been speaking in
the Senate in the debate on this bill – and says the border crisis is 'devastating
my state'.
Just last week, she says, officers seized 2.1 million fentanyl
pills at a port of entry, and elsewhere that same week border patrol agents recovered enough fentanyl to
kill 340,000 Americans.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that's 50 times stronger than heroin. 
Because it's cheap and easy to produce and transport, Mexican drug cartels have begun to cut it into recreational drugs like cocaine. The epidemic has hit the US, which is the world's biggest market for illegal drugs, especially hard.
Our correspondent Will Grant travelled to Tijuana, Mexico, and published this report yesterday on the scale of the problem on both sides of the border.
Sinema is one of the architects of this bill, and has been working with colleagues Chris Murphy and James Lankford for months on it.

James Lankford, the lead Republican negotiator on this bill, just made a final pitch for the bill he has worked on for months.
""We knew from the beginning, it wasn't going to be perfect, but the status quo is untenable,"" he says.
""If we're going to solve something, we HAVE to do it together.""
Though mild-mannered in nature, Lankford's exasperation was clear.
He lamented that colleagues ""literally within minutes [of the bill's release] said 'I don't agree'"".
Social media amplified lies about the bill, he said with a giant sigh. He calls these claims ""completely absurd"".
Lankford goes on to say a ""popular commentator"" he spoke to months ago threatened to do ""whatever I can to destroy you"" if he tried to pass border reforms in an election year.
Holding up the pen he received after being sworn in to the Senate in 2015, Lankford says ""people sent me here to get stuff done and solve problems"".
 His staff skipped Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's celebrations to write the legislation, he added.
""Let's make progress,"" he urged. It is hard not to feel bad for him here.

While we wait for the vote, senators have been speaking in the chamber.
We just heard from Democrat Senator Patty Murray, who said Republicans who vote against the bill will be telling the American people they ""don't want to solve the crisis on the border"", they want to campaign on it.

The US ""can and will"" give more military aid to Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan vowed earlier today - saying the White House is focused on getting a Ukraine package through Congress.
Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Sullivan admitted there had been a ""lot of to-ing and fro-ing"" in Congress - and added ""in the last 24 hours you've seen a significant number of Republicans come out and say that no matter what else happens, we need to move forward a package of support for Ukraine"".
""We believe we still can and will deliver aid for Ukraine,"" he told reporters at the news conference.
US military aid to Ukraine has been on hold since December because Congress hasn't been able to agree to send more. 
Republicans had said they would only support more aid for Ukraine if they get concessions on border security - hence why we've got this legislation today.

We've just had another sign that there's no real confidence in this border and foreign aid bill getting through the Senate.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has recently unveiled the text of a new foreign aid package - one with no mention of border security. 
In total, the bill includes 
$60bn for Ukraine
, 
$14.1bn in security assistance for Israel 
and 
$9.15bn for humanitarian purposes.
Another 
$2.44bn 
has been slated to support 
US operations in the Red Sea
, and 
$4.83bn 
has been allocated to 
support US allies in the Pacific 
""and deter aggression by the Chinese government"".
""If our Republican colleagues won't even debate bipartisan border policy, then we must proceed with the rest of the supplemental package and get aid to our allies and to innocent civilians in urgent need,"" Washington Senator Patty Murray, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly 
plans to force a vote on the bill later today
, after the Senate votes on the original foreign aid bill that included border security provisions.

It's not just Republicans who are opposed to this bill.
Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has vowed to vote no, citing what he termed as Israel's ""horrific war"" in Gaza. 
The bill includes $10bn (£7.92bn) in US military aid for Israel, in addition to the funds it has earmarked for border security and Ukraine. 
In a statement posted online, Sanders said that while ""Israel has a right to defend itself"", it does not ""have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people"".
Sanders said that additional aid to Israel amid the conflict is ""unconscionable"". 
""That is why I will be voting NO,"" the statement adds.

Reporting from Capitol Hill
The Senate is now set to vote at 
14:00e (19:00g)
 on a long-anticipated bill, but nobody seems thrilled up here on Capitol Hill.
The new aid to Ukraine and Israel offered in this $118bn (£93bn) bill was teed up by President Joe Biden in a primetime speech back in October, while Republicans have been clamouring for border security provisions for even longer.
Bipartisan negotiations over this massive bill have taken four months.
And yet, on the verge of the vote, everybody is certain it will fail.
Moderates on either side are expected to back the bill, but several Republicans - taking their cue from former President Donald Trump and their House colleagues - and progressive Democrats have balked at the border reforms. Jointly, their opposition may be enough to sink the bill.
So likely is this bill to fail that the text of a backup bill - which comprises new foreign aid, but no border money - has just been released.

Trump - who is campaigning on immigration - has attacked the border security bill
Image caption: Trump - who is campaigning on immigration - has attacked the border security bill
President Joe Biden conceded that ""all indications are this bill won't even move forward"", despite the support of the Border Patrol Union.
""Why?"" he asked. ""A simple reason: Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.""
Biden said the former president had spent the past 24 hours lobbying Republicans in the House and Senate in an effort to torpedo the proposal.
He said Trump had tried to intimidate Republican lawmakers, ""and it looks like they're caving"".
The Trump campaign blasted the Biden speech, calling it ""an embarrassment to our nation and a slap in the face to the American people"".
On Monday morning after the details of the deal emerged, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and said ""only a fool, or a radical left Democrat"" would vote for the ""horrendous"" bill.
But some Democrats to the left of the party on immigration have also expressed displeasure with the bill.
Pramila Jayapal, a Washington congresswoman, said its provisions are ""not serious reform and it once again throws immigrants under the political bus"".
Immigration has emerged as the top issue driving Republicans to the polls in support of Donald Trump, the front-runner to face Joe Biden in the November general election.
Since Biden took office in January 2021, more than 6.3 million migrants have been detained crossing into the US illegally between points of entry, according to statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS.
The bill needs at least 60 votes to advance through the 100-member Senate and it looks like an uphill battle to get to that point.
""The 'border deal' is an easy NO. It reads like a parody of an actual border security bill,"" said Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican senator.
Widespread opposition to the deal among House Republicans means that the immigration bill is unlikely ever to become law.
Many have demanded stricter asylum restrictions, limiting programmes allowing migrants to live and work in the US while they wait for hearings.
House Republican leaders claimed that the bill cannot pass their chamber because it ""fails in every policy area needed to secure our border and would actually incentivise more illegal immigration"".
Included in the huge 
$118bn
 funding deal is 
$60bn
 to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and 
$14bn
 in security assistance for Israel.
The military aid became part of a US-Mexico border deal because Republicans said they would not agree to more money being sent to Ukraine until action was taken to fix the migrant crisis.
The bill would introduce much more severe measures to try to stem border crossings, which are at record levels.
The 
370-page agreement
 will, in the words of Republican negotiator James Lankford, move from the current system of ""catch and release"" to one where migrants are detained and deported.
Among the most significant changes in the deal is a new federal authority that mandates a complete shutdown of the border when migrant crossings reach a one-week average threshold of 5,000 a day or exceed 8,500 in a single day.
In practice, this would mean that migrants who arrive in the US illegally would no longer be allowed to request asylum and would be deported shortly thereafter.

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US Senate as lawmakers prepare to vote on a contentious border bill.
It's not just about the US-Mexico border. It also includes billions of dollars of support for Ukraine and Israel.
But it faces an uphill battle to make through the Senate today, with Republicans expected to torpedo it after Donald Trump said ""only a fool, or a radical left Democrat"" would vote for the bill.
The bill, which senators of both parties have spent months negotiating, 
was unveiled on Sunday night.
Faced with mounting public anger over the migrant inflows, President Joe Biden vowed in January to ""shut down the border right now and fix it quickly"" if Congress sent a bill to his desk.
But Republicans have rejected the measure, alleging its border reforms did not go far enough.

Confessions of an AI Clickbait Kingpin,Condé Nast,2024-02-07 12:00:00,full,https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-an-ai-clickbait-kingpin,wired.com,Serbian DJ turned internet entrepreneur Nebojša Vujinović Vujo floods abandoned news sites with AI-generated articles. But he wants you to know he's a nice guy.,"'I'm not a fan of AI,' Nebojša Vujinović Vujo says. The admission surprises me: He has built a bustling business by snapping up abandoned news outlets and other websites and stuffing them full of algorithmically generated articles. Although he accepts that his model rankles writers and readers alike, he says he's simply embracing an unstoppable new tool—large language models—in the same way people rationally swapped horse-drawn buggies for gas-powered vehicles. 'I hate cars. They're making my planet bad,' he says. 'But I'm not riding a horse anymore, right? I'm driving a car.'

I connected with Vujo after digging into the strange afterlife of indie women's blog The Hairpin, which shut down in 2018. Last month, its website reawakened. In place of the voicey, funny blog posts it was known for, the site began churning out AI-generated, search-engine-optimized pablum about dream interpretations and painfully generic relationship advice like 'effective communication is vital.'



When I emailed an address listed on the zombie site's About Us page, Vujo responded, claiming that it was just one of more than 2,000 sites he operates, in an AI-content-fueled fiefdom built by acquiring once-popular domains fallen on hard times. He's the CEO of the digital marketing firm Shantel, which monetizes its AI-populated sites through programmatic ads, sponsored content, and selling the placement of 'backlinks' to website owners trying to boost their credibility with search engines. He often targets distressed media sites because they have built-in audiences and a history of ranking highly in search results.

The foundation of that business is a long-established practice known as domain squatting—buying up web domains that once belonged to established brands and profiting off their reputations with Google and other search engines. Lily Ray, senior director of SEO at the marketing agency Amsive, calls it 'the underbelly of the SEO industry.' But Vujo is part of a wave of entrepreneurs giving this old trade a new twist by using generative AI.

It's dusk where I live in Chicago when I talk via Zoom with Nebojša Vujinović Vujo. (Although that's the name he gives me, he has sometimes gone by just Nebojša Vujinović, including on the registration information for some of his domains.) It's midnight in Belgrade, Serbia, where he lives with his girlfriend and their toddler, but he's wide awake and chatty. Vujo attributes his erratic sleep schedule to years of late nights working as a DJ and still makes music—he likes to mix pop with Balkan folk and is working on a new song called 'Fat Lady.' But right now he's eager to talk, human-to-human, about his AI-fueled hustle.

He gets why writers are unhappy that their work has been erased and replaced by clickbait. (The Hairpin's founding editor, Edith Zimmerman, calls his version of the site 'grim.') But he defends his choices, pointing out that his life has been tougher than that of the average American blogger. Although ethnically Serbian, Vujo was born in what is now known as Bosnia and Herzegovina, and his family fled during the breakup of Yugoslavia. 'I had two wars I escaped. I changed nine elementary schools because we were moving. We were migrants,' he says. 'It was terrible to grow up in this part of the world.' He says his economic options have been limited, and this was simply a path available to him.

Vujo also insists that he does have editorial standards; although the majority of the blog posts he publishes are created with ChatGPT, he employs a staff of about a dozen human editors to check its work to avoid anything outright offensive. 'Maybe it would be better for you that I'm a bad guy,' he tells me. 'Better for your story. But I'm just an ordinary guy.'

Easy, Fast, and Insane

Vujo's first big domain squatting victory came in 2017 when Italian chef Antonio Carluccio died, and it appears someone forgot to renew one of the websites associated with him. Vujo still talks about his good luck in scooping up the domain and turning it into a cooking-themed content mill. 'It's mine now,' he tells me cheerfully. 'He almost invented carbonara—he's a big celebrity!' Vujo has since also picked up Pope2you.net, formerly an official Vatican website meant to connect Pope Benedict XVI with younger believers, and TrumpPlaza.com, named after residential towers in Jersey City, New Jersey, codeveloped by former President Trump.

Vujo says his most significant—and consistently profitable—purchase is women's media outlet The Frisky, which he acquired not long after he scored the Carluccio site. 'It cost a lot—all the money that I had—but that was my opportunity,' he says. 'It was life-changing.' (BuzzFeed News reported on the purchase in 2019.) Vujo says the site generated over $500,000 in the first year he bought the domain. In addition to healthy income from ads and clients willing to pay for backlinks, the brand was a magnet for companies willing to pay for sponsored posts. Because the outlet had long embraced risque topics, Vujo says sex toy companies are eager to do business with him.",wired.com,142,1,US,en,"Amanda Hoover,Andy Greenberg,Christopher Null,Condé Nast,Dexter Thomas,Joel Khalili,Kate Knibbs,Lauren Goode,Makena Kelly,Will Knight","https://media.wired.com/photos/65c185b1bba36dfa01f19fc5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/culture_ai_clickbait_kingpin.jpg",False,@wired,3.2604299,bb375d296ce5a8a4c69211a5f8770491,"['AI-generated articles', 'algorithmically generated', 'domain squatting', 'generative AI', 'digital marketing']","Nebojša Vujinović Vujo, CEO of digital marketing firm Shantel, operates over 2,000 websites that generate AI-generated articles through domain squatting.

"A Ukrainian Brigade Ran Low On Ammo. That, Plus Some Bad Weather, Was All The Advantage Russian Troops Needed To Breach Avdiivka.",David Axe,2024-02-07 03:52:54,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/06/a-ukrainian-brigade-ran-low-on-ammo-that-plus-some-bad-weather-was-all-the-advantage-russian-troops-needed-to-breach-avdiivka/,forbes.com,"'The situation in the city has become critical,' Ukrainian journalist Andriy Tsaplienko wrote about Avdiivka.","Marching quickly under a cloudy sky on Sunday, Russian troops infiltrated Avdiivka.

Four months after a pair of Russian field armies, together with 40,000 troops and thousands of vehicles, first attacked toward Avdiivka—a Ukrainian stronghold just northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine—the long, bloody campaign may be culminating.

'The situation in the city has become critical,' Ukrainian journalist Andriy Tsaplienko wrote.

If the campaign does culminate, and the Russians prevail, it will be clear who largely is to blame: Russia-aligned Republicans in the U.S. Congress, who last fall began blockading U.S. aid to Ukraine and, as a consequence, starved Ukrainian troops of the ammunition they depend on to match the Russians' own firepower.

'Avdiivka urgently needs fresh reserves and rotation of units,' Ukrainian correspondent Yuriy Butusov explained Sunday. 'Ammunition is also necessary— supplies are also extremely small [and] the enemy has a great advantage.'

The Avdiivka garrison has held for a decade—ever since Russian troops and their allies first attacked in eastern Ukraine, back in 2014. And for the nearly two years since Russia widened its war on Ukraine, the soldiers of the Ukrainian army's 110th Mechanized Brigade have been the city's main defenders.

It's not that the Ukrainian eastern command didn't reinforce Avdiivka when it became clear that conquering the city was one of the Kremlin's main objectives: it did.

The elite 47th Mechanized Brigade with its American-made M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles rolled into positions north of Avdiivka in order to defend Stepove, an adjacent settlement. The 53rd Mechanized Brigade meanwhile arrived south of Avdiivka.

But the 110th Brigade plus some border guards and commandos alone defended the city center.

The 2,000-person brigade never has rotated out for rest. Day after day, it fights: infantry pile into trenches; drone-operators scurry into abandoned buildings to set up antennae and launch their explosive, one-way drones; gunners take aim with grenade-launchers and anti-tank missiles.

For four months, the 110th and reinforcing brigades bled attacking Russian columns. By December, the Russians had suffered 13,000 casualties—dead and maimed—and lost hundreds of armored vehicles. Two months later, their casualties may have doubled.

But the Kremlin keeps feeding fresh troops into the meat-grinder. Slowly, and at great cost in people and equipment, the Russians inched forward—first on Avdiivka's flanks, and then into the city itself.

The Ukrainians' small drones always were the key to the city's defense. Surveillance drones would spot the Russians coming. First-person-view attack drones would harry them until Ukrainian infantry or M-2 and tank crews could finish them off.

When the clouds gathered on Sunday, grounding many drones and blinding others, the Russians heaved forward. Scurrying along the edge of a quarry abutting the city's northern edge, Russian troops 'bypassed the Ukrainian battle formations and entrenched themselves in the buildings,' according to Tsaplienko.

Butusov described the panic as the 110th Brigade scrambled to respond. Officers ordered everyone, even elderly mechanics, to grab weapons and head for the trenches. 'These grandfathers left,' Butusov quoted a source as saying. 'Most of them died in battle.'

'I saw from a drone how an assault group of Russians attacked a house ... where two of our fighters fought to the last,' Butusov added. 'The house burned down, no one surrendered.'

If the Russians can hang onto their new positions in northern Avdiivka, they can threaten the Ukrainian garrison's supply lines, threading into the ruined city from the west. As of Sunday, the Russians were just a few hundred yards from the main road in, Tsaplienko wrote. Close enough to hit trucks with handheld weapons.

Avdiivka may fall, potentially making it the first Ukrainian city the Russians have captured since seizing Bakhmut nine months ago. If that happens, the Republicans who deprived the Ukrainians of ammunition shoulder much of the blame.

They can't claim they didn't know their intransigence might result in Ukrainian mechanics dying in cold trenches as the Ukrainians' supporting guns fell silent. As early as December, around six weeks after Republicans first began blocking aid, Ukrainian units in and around Avdiivka noted their arsenals emptying out.

On Dec. 17, a Russian column took advantage of a foggy day and attacked Avdiivka from the south. Ukrainian drone-operators eventually spotted the Russians, but lacked any means of striking them. 'We just don't have ammo,' one operator wrote.

The Russian column struck a mine and turned back. The Ukrainian drone crews watched the Russians walk back to the safety of their own lines. 'It's very, very awful to see how Russians are walking without punishment,' the operator complained.

Those same Russians seemingly survived to attack again. And again. Until the weather, and the Ukrainians' dwindling firepower, finally welcomed them into Avdiivka.",forbes.com,49,5,US,en,"David Axe,Forbes Staff","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c2fc703dbff45775a516a5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2048,959,x0,y201,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",False,@forbes,3.252701,1c94ba2fa00a36b1e590b6e95023868d,"['Avdiivka', 'Russian troops', 'Ukraine', 'ammunition', 'Russian attack']","Russian troops infiltrated Avdiivka, a Ukrainian stronghold, after a long and bloody campaign.

Students on hunger strike call for Brown University to divest from pro-Israel companies,Adam Gabbatt,2024-02-07 13:00:48,full,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/07/brown-university-palestine-hunger-strike-israel-divestment,theguardian.com,"Group demands school divest from companies including Boeing and RTX, who they say profit from Israel's military attacks in Gaza","A group of 19 students at Brown University have gone on hunger strike, calling for the school to divest from 'companies which profit from human rights abuses in Palestine'.
The move follows months of protests and 
sit-ins
 at universities around the country, which have seen students arrested as they protest against Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza.
The strike at the Ivy League university, which began on 2 February, will continue until Brown University considers a proposal on divestment, the students said. It comes amid a growth in protests calling for colleges and local governments to divest from assets linked to 
Israel
 and the Israeli military.
'We've gone through a lot of other means of showing the university where we were standing and what our demands were,' said Niyanta Nepal, one of the striking students.
'Organizing has been going on for over 10 years on this campus around this issue. We've had vigils, we've held various programs to get students tuned in, and since October 7, it escalated to sit-ins where, at this date, 61 students have been arrested,' Nepal, 21, said. 'The hunger strike felt like the next appropriate step.'
Brown, located in Rhode Island, has been at the forefront of protests over the 
Israel-Gaza war
. More than 60 students have been arrested during actions in the past three months.
In November Hisham Awartani, a Palestinian student at Brown who had been involved in campus activism, was 
shot, along with two friends
, in an unrelated incident in Vermont. Awartani believes they were the 
victims of a hate crime
 – Jason Eaton, 48, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder.
The hunger strike is taking place as 
more than 100 people
 were arrested at the Pennsylvania state capitol on Monday, during a protest against the state's investment in Israeli bonds, while last week faculty members at the University of Michigan 
passed a resolution
 calling for the university to divest from companies 'that profit from Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza'.
The Brown students' 
divestment proposal
 follows 
a similar proposal
 made in 2020 by Brown's advisory committee on corporate responsibility in investment policies (ACCRIP), an advisory board to the university's president. The students are calling for Brown to divest from RTX Corporation, a weapons manufacturer; Northrop Grumman, a military company; and Boeing and Airbus, among others.
The students say they will continue their hunger strike until the corporation of Brown University, the school's governing body, agrees to consider the proposal during its pre-scheduled meetings beginning on 8 February.
A spokesperson for Brown said the university 'is not directly invested in any defense stocks or large munitions manufacturers'. He said Brown is prohibited by 'confidentially provisions' from sharing details of what assets Brown holds through external investment companies.
Christina Paxson, the president of Brown, told students in a letter on Friday that she did not plan to raise the topic of divestment during the board meetings.

'It is not appropriate for the university to use its financial assets – which are there to support our entire community – to ‘take a side' on issues on which thoughtful people vehemently disagree,' Paxson wrote.
However, given Brown's history, students are hopeful for success.
'We've seen historically that it's taken a lot of pressure from student activism, from local activism, to get the university to do the right thing. We've seen that with 
South African apartheid
 on this campus, we've seen that with [Brown] 
divesting from Sudan
, 
from tobacco
 – all these things have stemmed from this greater student pressure,' Ariela Rosenzweig, a member of Brown's Jews for Ceasefire Now who is taking part in the hunger strike.
It comes at a dramatic time for colleges in the US. In January, Claudine Gay resigned as president of Harvard University, following 
a rightwing campaign
 sparked by her 
response to questions
 about alleged antisemitism on campus. Elizabeth Magill, the then president of University of Pennsylvania who gave testimony alongside Gay in Congress, resigned in December after facing similar animus.
In October, some companies said they

Resolution Rundown: Five Key Cybersecurity Actions For 2024,Kevin Korte,2024-02-07 12:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/07/resolution-rundown-five-key-cybersecurity-actions-for-2024/,forbes.com,We should put more effort into improving our tech habits and help fellow employees and co-workers develop better habits.,"President of Univention North America, making sure you stay in control of your data, your company and your future.

2023 has proven to be one of the most decisive years in cybersecurity. From record levels of ransomware attacks to the initial impact of AI and the wishful thinking that we may have a better arsenal to fend off the bad guys, we experienced a lot of ""firsts"" last year. However, in many ways, it also demonstrated that despite rapid technological advances, humans are still the leading cause of problems and attacks. Verizon reports in its 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report that 74% of all breaches involve a human element.

What should we do if cybersecurity comes largely down to how we behave online? We should put more effort into improving our tech habits and help fellow employees and co-workers develop better habits. There are five areas in cybersecurity where I think improvements are possible.

Secure Your Access

Whether we're employees or customers, humans are not very good at following their well-meaning intentions when it comes to cybersecurity. The problem with adhering to security protocols is that we can't see that they're working until it's too late, which only strengthens our innate tendency to ignore the issue.

That's why password stuffing, or reusing a password from a database to get into another system, is still among the leading causes of cybersecurity incidents. It's no wonder that businesses consider it one of their top priorities to force employees and customers to use more secure authentication mechanisms such as multifactor authentication or passwordless access.

They have a good point. Every one of us should try to take advantage of these security mechanisms and, if they're not available, use secure password managers to better safeguard our data and online identities.

Secure Your Edge

The latest round of published cybersecurity incidents has hit water suppliers. The targets weren't traditional computers but some of the millions of networked devices we find in every home and business. From door locks and fridges to industrial computers and networking equipment, many devices in our homes and enterprises today require passwords, access keys and updates.

With the increasing adoption of smart buildings, smart businesses and smart homes, we will see such devices proliferate. IT departments should therefore make it a habit to include them in their update rotation, and consumers must turn on auto-updates. It goes without saying that everyone should change the notorious ""1111"" password to a more secure option. The same precautions should apply to personal devices used for work since they are often the preferred attack vector.

Secure Your Identity

The rise of social media has brought us an incessant barrage of holiday snapshots and all sorts of other deeply personal pictures. For a long time, police have warned that criminals use this type of information to schedule break-ins and other heists. Scams and phishing attempts, too, utilize this carelessly shared data stream to increase their success rate.

The wildfire adoption of AI tools has supercharged these attacks. Messages from loved ones, job offers and tempting sales are just a convenient click away, and many times, they are too good to be true. Thanks to our abundant private information that now floats around the internet, AI can massage and adapt fake messages to sound and look natural. The genuine, human-like tone and appearance of today's attacks are worlds apart from the not-too-distant past when spelling errors and grammatical mistakes gave away attempts to fool us.

The antidote? Become more mindful of how much you share and with whom. Especially for personal information, we need to become more aware of how criminals can siphon it off public channels and misuse it.

Businesses, for their part, need to include this crucial topic in their cybersecurity training. Lessons and workshops need to go way beyond "" don't share company internals on War Thunder"" and instead include actionable steps to staying secure online, including team members' personal posts.

Secure Your Data

Data privacy and protection rules have stiffened worldwide in recent years. Yet, especially in the U.S., most of us are still at the mercy of company policies and mandatory arbitration rules. We should get into the habit of reading and understanding these texts. All too often, companies track us and collect data just because they might, one day soon, be able to monetize them. Opting out, not allowing cookies and steering clear of the worst services can help significantly improve cybersecurity. After all, hackers cannot steal data that doesn't exist in the first place.

Similarly, businesses should replace data collection and protection with data avoidance strategies. If we reduce the amount of data stored, we reduce the risk of incidents. Fewer incidents, in turn, mean fewer chances that legislators and regulators feel the need to interfere with our business practices, and they preserve customer trust.

Secure Your Emotions

Beyond the traditional technical advice, we have to recognize that many of our decisions hinge on our mental state when we type, swipe and click. Stress and bad habits contribute more to cybersecurity vulnerabilities than any technical issue. We must therefore consider stress management, habit-building and communication styles to advance cybersecurity.

It might sound counterintuitive, but reducing distractions at work by removing notifications, keeping stricter schedules and standing up from our desks now and then to stretch can do more to enhance cybersecurity than any tool.

Reducing the application load and streamlining IT interactions can significantly reduce business stress. Likewise, counseling and mentoring after someone falls for a cyberattack will dramatically help avoid a repeat incident and prevent burnout.

A Better New Year

Cybersecurity costs have been on the rise every year. 2023 wasn't different. Yet, every year, we continue throwing more technology at the issue. However, the hope that new tools can eliminate human errors is a fallacy that will continue to cost us more and more money.

Instead, we should examine our personal habits, and companies should work on helping employees build better routines. In the final analysis, focusing on small accomplishments, automation and ease of use will make our IT more secure than any new-fangled AI tool.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,2,US,en,"Council Post,Forbes Councils Member,Kevin Korte",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/60db2d433d0d7ac52749e817/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,3.014609,aced1f2cc58ffd17eb4a84f39de13b2a,"['cybersecurity', 'data breach', 'password stuffing', 'smart devices', 'data privacy']","The article discusses the importance of improving cybersecurity habits in five areas: securing access, securing edge devices, securing identity, securing data, and securing emotions.

Keir Starmer's method has worked so far – now begins his toughest test,Rafael Behr,2024-02-07 06:00:06,full,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/07/labour-power-party-keir-starmer,theguardian.com,"Election campaigns are about making the political weather. And on that crucial test, Labour is struggling, says the Guardian columnist Rafael Behr","T
he sky was reliably clear over May Day parades in the Soviet Union, not because it never rains in Moscow but because the Kremlin would order the dispersal of any clouds. This was done with blasts of silver iodide, or dry ice, provoking precipitation in the morning so none fell on Red Square in the afternoon.
That is what 'making the weather' involves in authoritarian states. The supreme ruler dictates what will appear in the news bulletin and the subsequent meteorological forecast.
Setting the agenda is trickier in democracies, where the market for public attention is competitive. It is harder for oppositions than governments. The hypothetical realm of what might happen under a different government is rarely more relevant to the distracted voter than whatever the actual prime minister is doing right now. Governments can make laws; oppositions can only make promises, which are a much-debased currency in British politics.
On the metric that counts, Keir Starmer is succeeding in a field where most fail. He is 
preferred to Rishi Sunak as a possible prime minister
. Labour has a commanding poll lead over the Tories. Much of that speaks to voters recoiling from the smell of a rotten government, but a worse opposition leader could still have squandered the advantage.
Critics lament the absence of boldness in Starmer's prospectus, but the pressing public demand is for inoffensive competence. That is not something swing voters associate with Labour's more radical tendency.
Excavating the party from the sinkhole of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership was the first phase of what Labour strategists describe as a three-stage plan. Phase two was prosecuting the case that the Tories were unfit for government. Phase three is filling that vacancy with a credible Labour offer.
In that account, there is a certain amount of retrofitting coherence on what was, in reality, a gradual dawning in Starmer's mind of what needed to be done. He was sincere in the leadership contest that he won with pledges of continuity with Corbynism, 
but then unsentimentally ruthless
 once he understood that the left was anchoring him in a zone of perpetual defeat.
With an election coming into view, the project is now in phase three. This is based around the 
five 'missions' that Starmer set out
 a year ago: green energy, a soaring economy, an NHS that works, safe streets and 'opportunity for all'. These pillars are to be clad with policy to make the platform from which Starmer can rally the nation.
If you hadn't noticed this happening, it is because other things also keep happening – war in the Middle East, 
Stormont reconvening
, endless rows about immigration.
Phase three is when Labour makes the weather, instead of just cruising in the prevailing anti-Tory wind. But this is also where the advantage of being anodyne and the imperative of getting noticed cancel each other out.
The problem is illustrated in 
the saga of £28bn 
annual investment in a 
'green industrial revolution'
 that was pledged in 2021 and subsequently caveated to the brink of extinction. It is now an aspiration subject to a test of fiscal prudence.

Depending on whom you ask, the £28bn figure is either a beacon of idealistic ambition or a budget albatross around the neck of a party that is vulnerable to charges of reckless borrowing. The latter view weighs heavily on the shadow Treasury team. Meanwhile, those tasked with planning the election campaign worry that a £28bn bill will get more traction as a scare tactic on Tory leaflets than as a pledge on Labour ones.
It doesn't help that the policy's most evangelical advocate is Ed Miliband. The shadow energy secretary and former leader has a certain untouchable seniority as someone who has actually run a Whitehall department, on a team that lacks practical experience of government.
But Labour's upper echelons also include veterans of the 2015 general election defeat. They complain that Miliband's main area of expertise is 
throwing away opinion-poll leads,
 and want his political butterfingers kept away from Starmer's manifesto.
Starmer himself 
navigates a convoluted line
 between defending the idea that growth can be unlocked if government borrows to invest, while trying not to get snagged on the totemic £28bn figure.
It can be simultaneously true that the state must cofinance transition to a low-carbon future, and also that voters struggle to discern a retail offer in that argument. It can be true that Starmer needs a mandate to enact big changes and also that the public get nervous around Labour leaders writing big cheques.
Starmer is striving to keep a flagship policy afloat without handing the Tories ammunition to use against him. It is a reasonable balance to want to strike, but balance requires nuance; and, sadly, nuance doesn't make the weather.
Starmer's judgment has been shrewd enough to get him closer to victory than his denigrators imagined possible nearly four years ago. That wins him loyalty, but not much benefit of the doubt. There is a nervousness, a brittleness in Labour's mood that expresses more than the traditional dread of a sudden contraction in the poll lead (although that fear is real enough). Continuing Conservative implosion is a plausible scenario but not guaranteed. A moribund government feeding attack lines to a feral press can still take chunks out of the opposition in a savage campaign.
This is the moment when command of the weather becomes vital. Labour MPs have their instructions: don't stride into traps; don't take the bait on tax cuts or asylum rules; don't accept Downing Street's framing of the election as a test of whether Labour can be trusted. Pose instead the question of whether Britain can cope with another term of Tory misrule.
That is all sound advice, but changing the subject in politics – steering the national conversation on to your issue, on your terms – is a job only the leader can do. It needs an aerial projection of the rare chemical element that disperses ominous clouds and clears the air. It is a quality Starmer has yet to display.
He enjoys formidable control of the Labour apparatus. Prising Corbynite hands away from levers of party machinery was what phase one meant in practice. There is now an impressive level of message discipline, delivered with dreary automaticity. There is loyalty, but it often sounds shallow: gratitude that the plan is working, without depth in feeling for what lies behind the plan.
There is an inscrutability around the leader that means even those who should be called Starmerites don't seem to know his mind. They can't intuit his positions in advance, which means they don't radiate the belief that constitutes a dedicated following, cushioning a leader in times of adversity.
This isn't a problem when the party is marching in close formation towards victory. It will be a problem soon enough, when the going gets harder and the rain starts falling on Labour's parade.

Queensland's African diaspora ‘a community under siege' as teenager faces murder charge over fatal stabbing of 70-year-old,Ben Smee,2024-02-06 23:20:39,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/queenslands-african-diaspora-a-community-under-siege-as-teenager-faces-charge-over-fatal-stabbing-of-70-year-old,theguardian.com,Premier condemns alleged racist responses as authorities and advocates say communities should not be blamed over the alleged actions of individuals,"'We are a community under siege at the moment, because of that tragic incident,' says Beny Bol, a refugee from South Sudan and a leader among Queensland's African diaspora.
Police have charged a 16-year-old boy with murder in relation to the stabbing death of Ipswich woman Vyleen White in a shopping centre car park in front of her six-year-old granddaughter. Four other boys have been arrested and face charges related to her allegedly stolen vehicle.
The incident has stirred visceral reactions; an outpouring of grief in Brisbane's outskirts. In some cases that grief has given way to vitriol – directed at people of African descent.
Footage released by police at the weekend showed four black males allegedly with White's car, described as 'people of interest' that police wished to locate. Police have not spoken publicly about the nationalities of the individuals that were subsequently arrested in connection with the incident.
Bol, the president of the Queensland African Communities Council, told Guardian Australia that incidents targeting African people had become worrying. He has told workers at the African centre in Redbank Plains, near where the stabbing occurred, to stay away after some said they had experienced abuse while heading to work on Monday.
'Over the last 24 hours I've received a large number of reports of people … who are being physically attacked while going to work or shopping,' Bol said.
'I've had a story of a young African girl who went to the shop and saw someone throw something at her [and say] ‘you're monkeys, go back to where you came from'.
'The commentary on social media I can't even talk about it, the level of stress that's causing to the community, that's unacceptable. Children are refusing to go to school because of the fear, too many people have been abused.'
The premier, Steven Miles, addressed concerns at a press conference on Tuesday.

'There's no place for this to be viewed through a racial lens,' Miles said.
'There's just no place for that kind of response or racism in our state and I would condemn it in the strongest possible terms.'
Division and unity
The Town Square Redbank Plains shopping centre was busy again by Tuesday. The underground car park where White was stabbed was open, but empty.
Guardian Australia visited the centre and spoke to several people with concerns about crime.
Some blame concerns about safety on the area's African community.
Guardian Australia spoke to some people who expressed views similar to those in newspaper columns, and by some far-right politicians, who believed cultural issues were at play.
On Tuesday, the Courier Mail published an opinion piece by an associate editor that sought to blame migrants and made unsupported claims that 'it seems a disproportionate number of crimes are committed by minorities who have failed to take note of the culture into which they've come'.
Bol bristles at the suggestion. He wants to make clear that the entire community – including people of African descent – were appalled by and had condemned the crime.
Bol said the justice system held individuals to account but that members of the African community were being collectively blamed for the alleged actions of some young people.
'We don't want any other family to go through the same thing again. We are all united to make sure our hearts are out there for the family of the victim. We need to prevent those things from happening in our community.
'It's sad to see there are members of our Australian community that fail to see the benefit of our multicultural democracy. We've seen around the world countries where … institutions have failed to accommodate diverse cultural institutions. We cannot be divided on race and religion.'
‘We all live together'
Online commentary, including on the pages of prominent Queensland anti-crime lobby groups, has veered from calls for the boys to be deported to those suggesting they should be killed.

Responding to concerns about threats made towards members of the African community, Det Acting Supt Heath McQueen said Ipswich police had spoken with community leaders who 'condemned what has occurred here'.
'Categorically, vigilantism has no place in our society … there is no place for that, I stand before you today and I've told you we've identified the person of interest for this offence.
'What we don't want is any more community behaviour causing any more fear or angst on any person. We all live together collectively in the community and that's what we aim to achieve.'
Asked about comments from White's husband, Victor, saying crime laws were 'weak as water', Miles said: 'I completely understand how Victor is feeling, he's grieving and is sad and angry … It's an awful crime.
'But nobody can seriously stand up and say they could have prevented this further.
'I've heard some politicians get very close to saying that they guarantee they could have prevented this murder. That's a pretty incredible statement to be trying to make.'
A vicious cycle
Rob White, a professor of criminology at the University of Tasmania, speaking generally, said the trend was towards fewer crimes being committed by migrant and refugee communities.
'Each crime needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis rather than commentators relying on gross generalisations about whole communities,' White said.
'Specific individuals are guilty of crime – communities are not. They need to be held to account, and suitable and appropriate sanctions and remedies applied.'
White said that 'moral panics' – especially targeting visible minorities and First Nations people – could simultaneously encourage racist attacks, and generate resentment and resistance within those communities.
'This is a vicious cycle in which no one is the winner it further entrenches fear of crime and fear of the ‘other' in the wider Australian community.'
Esther Gayflor came to Australia in 2004 as a refugee from the Liberian civil war. She works as a disability support worker and had shopped regularly at Town Square Redbank Plains for several years, even before 2016 when it was renovated.
'This is affecting me both ways,' she said.
Liberian refugee Esther Gayflor said she's experienced a sense of ‘us and them' in the wake of the alleged murder.

For very obvious climate reasons, it is we who must supply this invaluable modern fuel.","Starting in February 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has taught we in the West nothing if it hasn't proven the inherent value of natural gas.

Rising toward oil's prowess (how's that electric car revolution going?), gas is showing itself as the most invaluable energy resource in a world trying to meet ever-increasing energy needs, while also cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to fight climate change.

For example, generating a leading 40% of U.S. electricity, gas is clearly becoming more essential not just as a low-cost, reliable, and cleaner source of energy, but to also stabilize our power grid, backing up growing amounts of intermittent wind and solar power entering into the electric system.

Our wakeup call of 'more natural gas will be needed no matter what climate policies are passed' has thankfully begun even for our most energy ignorant.

And boy, there's a lot of them.

This is true for the richest, most developed economies, deploying the most 'progressive' energy policies to 'fight climate change.'

Governments in Europe, for instance, have formally adopted the 'natural gas is green' reality to ensure climate conscious private sector investors seeking to develop gas infrastructure: 'if you want to invest in natural gas, we've got your back.'

It sadly took Putin's war, but even the most climate-fixated nations are realizing that wind and solar are much more supplemental than alternative, especially when it comes to trying to displace highly reliable, available, and cleaner natural gas.

Desperately seeking 'green' economies like Germany, for instance, have reversed course on wind and solar and are trying to install as many liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities as possible – very telling since Germany is a global engineering powerhouse that should have all the resources to install that inevitable 'green revolution' we keep hearing about.

I knew I would be proven right: the natural limitations of wind and solar are causing Europe's climate goals to get watered down, by even the most ambitious 'climate hawks.'

Until it jumped-the-shark (shout out Fonz!) and starting pushing unrealistic (and dangerous) energy dreams, the International Energy Agency for years had global gas consumption rising, even under the most stringent climate policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

And why not? Gas emits up to 65% less CO2 than coal and 30% less than oil.

The global LNG market today is around 55 Bcf/d, and the long expectation has been a 4-7% annual rise in demand.

But even this could be a drastic underestimation: for example, way down from what we saw in 2022, the $2 gas in the U.S., $8 gas in Europe, and $10 gas in Asia that we have been seeing recently is locking in more gas infrastructure and thus usage.

Horrifically energy-deprived Africa, for instance, has natural gas as its centerpiece 'much more energy' strategy.

So, the end result here is very apparent: where do we want the world's natural gas to come from?

At 107 Bcf/d, the U.S. is the world's top gas producer, with Russia producing only about two-thirds of that.

While we're also now the world's largest LNG exporter (14-15 Bcf/d), we could come close to doubling that with already approved projects by 2028.

And to be sure, while the Biden administration is making a climate, energy, political, economical, and security blunder in putting a pause on new U.S. LNG approvals, that isn't exactly the focus of this article.

This is about how we should be promoting 'our cleanest' gas in the world.

The U.S. gas industry continues its march toward more certified gas using third-party certifiers (e.g., MiQ and Project Canary) to prove that this irreplaceable modern fuel is being produced and transported in ways that minimize GHG emissions the most (i.e., Responsibly Sourced Gas).

The Biden-Harris administration just finalized the strictest methane reduction standards ever on the U.S. gas industry, even assessing big charges on large emitters.

The U.S. gas industry will always be trying to lower emissions to gain a competitive advantage to reach the growing pot of climate conscious buyers, particularly over much higher-leaking systems and rival exports like those from Russia.

In addition, the gas industry's goal to enhance its ESG profile (to get access to more capital) demands to be 'as clean as possible,' a natural progression since leaked methane is lost product and thus lost revenues (the primary component of natural gas is methane, typically at least 90%)

As a simple example, the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy 2023 reports that the U.S. produces about 25% of the world's gas but accounts for just 6% of the flaring from gas; while Russia produces 15% of global gas, it accounts for 18% of the flaring from gas (see Figure).

Reducing emissions is exactly why U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm supported our LNG exports from the very beginning of her tenure.

As one of the most advanced scientific outfits in the world, the U.S. National Energy Technology Laboratory has concluded that Russian gas piped to Europe has up to 22% more GHG emissions than European coal.

In stark contrast, U.S. LNG delivered to Europe has up to 56% fewer total emissions than European coal.

And even all this is likely underestimating how comparably clean the U.S. gas supply system really is.

The Russian government has long been notorious for not allowing emission measurements from its gas sector.

Russia clearly operates a leaky, antiquated, unregulated system, pumping out huge amounts of fugitive methane emissions, probably five to eight times higher than the U.S. system.

This is a really big deal in our fight against climate change because reductions or limitations on domestic U.S. gas production and/or exports will simply be made up with production and/or exports elsewhere.

And these global gas suppliers (Putin's Gas Exporting Countries Forum) are sure to have far lower environmental standards than what we have here in the U.S.

Europe in particular is turning to the U.S. for our cleaner gas to help wean it off Russian supply, where Putin was supplying 40-45% of Europe's gas before he invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.

Even left-leaning Politico just cleared the air: ' U.S. rethinks gas exports, spooking Europe.'

While there are many major new projects coming to export LNG from the western coasts of Canada and Mexico, those shipments will obviously be going to Asia since their advantage is quicker, and thus cheaper, travel times, as compared to U.S. projects along the Gulf Coast that have to pass through the Panama Canal.

Without the U.S., global incremental LNG supply will be heading to energy-starved Asia and we could be, literally, be leaving Europe in the dark.

Europe's gas storage infrastructure is hardly sufficient, it covers just a third of winter demand, thus we need many more LNG facilities to help our friends there in winter especially.

We've been very lucky with these recent warmer-than-normal winters, eventually our luck will run out, and U.S. cleaner natural gas will be needed even more than ever.",forbes.com,49,6,US,en,Jude Clemente,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3e73b4180facdbc6695b7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,2.723291,d4233587cd1fa03c10c6db5ee1396bba,"['natural gas', 'energy', 'climate change', 'gas infrastructure', 'LNG']","The article discusses the increasing importance of natural gas as an energy resource, highlighting its role in meeting energy needs, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and stabilizing power grids.

The Top 10 Prompts To Maximize ChatGPT (get Better Results Faster),Jodie Cook,2024-02-07 13:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2024/02/07/the-top-10-prompts-to-maximize-chatgpt-get-better-results-faster/,forbes.com,Get good at prompting ChatGPT and supercharge your business with a trusty sidekick that won't give up. Generate output you're proud of by putting in some effort.,"Unless you learn how to use them properly, most AI tools have limited benefit. You're not just going to punch in a few prompts and have War and Peace appear before your eyes. You won't generate output you're proud of without putting in some effort. Learn the platform, learn how it works, then spend the time organizing the inputs for the best chance of success. Don't be afraid to start from scratch with a beginner's mind.

Rowan Cheung is founder of The Rundown, a fast-growing AI newsletter with 450,000 subscribers, taking daily, in-depth looks at the latest developments in AI. Cheung is on a mission to inform millions of people about the latest advancements in AI, including how to get more out of popular large language models such as ChatGPT. Academics Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Aidar Myrzakhan, and Zhiqiang Shen, who recently published 'Principled instructions are all you need for questioning LLaMA-½, GPT-3.5/4' for the Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI, want to help users in, 'simply curating better prompts.' Between them, they know about prompting.

'It is essential to craft prompts that the LLM can comprehend and respond to effectively,' said Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen, who outlined 26 prompt principles for instructions, grouped into five categories; (1) prompt structure and clarity, (2) specificity and information, (3) user interaction and engagement, (4) content and language style and (5) complex tasks and coding prompts. Ten of the principles were recommended by Cheung, to maximize ChatGPT and get better results faster, for the benefit of your business and schedule.

Maximize ChatGPT (and other LLMs) with these 10 prompts

1. Get a deeper understanding

'To clarify or get a deeper understanding of a topic, or any piece of information, use the following prompts,' explained Cheung. Options include, ' Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms, ' or ' Explain [concept] to me like I'm 11 years old,' and ' Explain [topic] to me as if I'm a beginner in [field]. '

ChatGPT knows how to simplify something, so asking it to output information in one of these ways will ensure everything you see has been boiled down to the essentials. The LLM will likely use basic language and helpful analogies to ensure you understand.

2. Replicate a sample

'If you need to mimic the style of a sample of text to create an essay or other written work, use this prompt,' advised Cheung, from the 'specificity and information' section of the principles. ""Please create [describe new text required] using language based on this sample, [include paragraph, text, essay, answer]."" ChatGPT will learn the style and follow it through to the new material.

Perhaps you're making tweets based on ones you already wrote, or releasing a series of articles along a similar theme. Use your tried-and-tested tone of voice to outproduce everyone, with no one guessing what you did.

3. Improve without changing the meaning

When you're sent testimonials, website or marketing copy, or a first draft that isn't quite right, use this prompt to tidy it up while keeping the essence of the message, according to the 'content and language style' section of the 26 principles. 'Revise every paragraph in this [type of text] sent by [specify who]. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual.'

Use this prompt when you're happy with the sentiment but want something to read better. ChatGPT should follow your instructions and make only edits that are absolutely necessary. The original writer might not even know you did anything at all.

4. Be clear on what you want

ChatGPT is not human and doesn't care about niceties. 'No need to be polite with LLM,' said Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen. It actually works better being instructed like a machine. The paper found better results when incorporating the following phrases within your prompt: ' Your task is, ' or ' You MUST, ' and ' You will be penalized. ' Tag them onto the end of your prompt and see how you get on.

You wouldn't say please and thank you to your fridge, or start pleading with your dishwasher if it didn't do the right thing. Just because ChatGPT engages like a human, remember it's a predictive word generator and should be instructed as such.

5. Tell ChatGPT how to think

You'd be forgiven for thinking OpenAI's flagship tool had a brain. When you're prompting, explained Cheung, 'use leading phrases like ‘think step by step, '' discovered from the 'prompt structure and clarity' section of the paper. Request that ChatGPT process and output information in a logical, sequential way, to enable you to do more with the words that come out. The paper also recommends you, 'Break down the task into a series of prompts that build upon each other, guiding the model step-by-step,' if that better suits the requirements.

If you were training an intern from scratch, you'd give them frameworks and methodologies. You'd teach them the best order of doing the task at hand, and see their plan for the work first, so they didn't get to the end having taken the wrong route. Think of prompting ChatGPT in a similar way to ensure it doesn't miss any stages.

6. Don't ignore frequency

People repeat the things that matter to them. They revisit their favourite places, they order their favourite menu items every time they go to the same restaurant. Apply this to prompting ChatGPT. Don't assume it knows what's important to you.

'Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt,' said Cheung. Even if you'd never repeat something that many times in real life, ChatGPT can't read body language or infer tone like you can in a human-to-human conversation. Spell it out, and say things multiple times to hammer the message home.

7. Use positive language

ChatGPT likes being told what to do. It doesn't like being told what not to do. 'Employ affirmative directives such as ‘ do, ' while steering clear of negative language like ‘ don't ',' explained Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen. Rather than ' don't waffle,' say ' be clear and concise.' Rather than saying ' don't use metaphors,' say ' be literal. '

Instructing in this way, while it takes some getting used to, will be more beneficial in the long term. Train your mind to go towards what you want instead of away from what you don't, and pass your thinking to ChatGPT.

8. Specify detailed output

One criticism of ChatGPT is that its first instinct is to use flowery, generic, vague language. It makes sense. The tool was trained on billions of words from across the internet, many of which will contradict each other. Competing messages water eachother down until there's nothing left to do but embellish. A camel is a horse built by a committee.

For more detailed output, you only have to ask. Cheung recommends you use this prompt. 'Write a detailed [type of text] for me on [topic] in detail by adding all the information necessary, ' then add further guidance on the direction this detail should take. Specify clarity, conciseness, and be clear on the structure and length required.

9. Check for bias

If you ask ChatGPT to describe a typical CEO, it will be the most stereotypical answer you could imagine. Same with a cleaner, parent or bar manager. Explaining your ideal customer to ChatGPT might mean it over-generalises or makes assumptions you didn't approve.

LLMs are inherently biased but they're working on becoming better. Make sure your output doesn't fall short by adding, ' Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes,' to the end of your prompt, advised Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen.

10. Assign a role

' Take on the role of [describe role], ' is the most basic prompt in the book. If you want an AI coach, ask for one. If you want a property expert, social media manager or a pre-gym David Goggins pep talk, tell ChatGPT. Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen found 'larger models possess a considerable capacity for simulation. The more precise the task or directive provided, the more effectively the model performs.' Therefore, they continued, 'it proves beneficial to assign a specific role to LLMs as a means to elicit outputs that better match our intended results.'

Don't forget that LLMs are predictive machines. They simply act to predict the next word in a sentence. If you want that sentence to come out a certain way, you have to frame its thinking, hence specifying a role in the prompt.

Maximize how you use LLMs like ChatGPT: 10 key considerations

Bsharat, Myrzakhan and Shen describe prompting as, 'the crafting of precise, task-specific instructions.' Doing this well is an art in itself, especially when, as they say, 'the task of reliably guiding LLMs to produce specific responses,' and 'making full use of the capability,' continues to 'pose a considerable challenge.' Get good at prompting and supercharge your business endeavors with a trusty sidekick that won't give up.

‘Harassed constantly': Imran Khan's party fights state pressure in Pakistan election,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,2024-02-07 13:58:51,full,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/harassed-constantly-imran-khans-party-fights-state-pressure-in-pakistan-election,theguardian.com,PTI turns to virtual rallies and AI-generated speeches from jailed leader after alleged intimidation and curbs on campaigning,"For months, police have blocked Arsalan Hafeez from entering into the Pakistani constituency where he will be standing for election this week.

Since he put himself forward as the candidate for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the political party led by Pakistan's now incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, Hafeez alleges that the state's machinery has done everything to prevent him being able to contest from his district of Narowal in the state of Punjab.

He claims rigorous police checkpoints have repeatedly blocked his entry and all attempts to campaign and hold rallies. Even attempts to talk to his potential voters have been obstructed by officers, he says. He also accuses police of attempting to intimidate him and his family to prevent him from putting forward his nomination papers at all.

'We have been harassed constantly by police, many of my workers arrested for trying to campaign, and I can't even go into my constituency,' said Hafeez. 'They have also registered many false cases against me. They are going after me like a criminal when all I am trying to do is freely fight an election.'

Hafeez's case is far from unique. Since violent protests erupted last May, leaders and workers of PTI allege they have undergone an unprecedented crackdown – including intimidation and arrests – designed to destroy the party and prevent them taking part in Pakistan's long-delayed elections, to be held on 8 February. On Thursday, 14 PTI candidates will be running from jail.

Khan, who has languished behind bars since his arrest in August, was suddenly sentenced in three separate cases last week: on Tuesday given 10 years in prison for allegedly leaking state secret, given 14 years in a corruption case on Wednesday, and on the weekend sentenced to seven years after it was ruled his marriage was illegal.

The flurry of harsh sentences was seen as a clear message that PTI would not be allowed to return to power this week. 'It's grotesque,' said Salman Akram Raja, a senior PTI leader running in the election. 'Candidates and people have been made to fear for their privacy, for their dignity, for their home, for their liberty if they come out and openly support PTI.'

Many in PTI, and voters on the streets, expressed concern that the election would be rigged to bring back the favoured candidate of Pakistan's powerful military, the three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, to power. A report by Crisis Group this week on the elections stated that the crackdown on PTI 'could have dire implications for the party's electoral prospects' and warned of 'tarnished elections' that could lack credibility.

Murtaza Solangi, the information minister in Pakistan's caretaker government, hit back at the allegations, calling them 'absurd, baseless and vehemently denied', and said that most of those arrested had been involved in 'violent attacks against the military and civilian installations'.

'Our constitution ensures free speech so they are able to make any accusation against the state,' said Solangi. 'No civilised country tolerates violent attacks against state.'

In a statement on the eve of the election, Pakistan's foreign office said they were 'fully committed to foster an inclusive democratic process'.

The sustained assault against Khan and PTI is seen to be driven by the country's powerful military, which has a long history of meddling in Pakistani politics. It was the military's backing that was seen to bring Khan to power in 2018 but after the relationship fell apart, it helped orchestrate his removal from office in 2022.

In the aftermath, Khan publicly turned on the military generals who had been his former allies, accusing them of controlling politics, bearing a personal grudge against him and attempting to assassinate him. Khan's damning rhetoric against the army fuelled unprecedented public anger on the streets towards the military, long seen as the kingmakers in Pakistan's politics and the main obstacle to the country's stilted progress towards democracy.

The state responded by arresting Khan, filing hundreds of cases against him and barring him from running for office, and carrying out a sustained campaign of harassment of thousands of PTI workers and supporters.

Dozens of senior PTI leaders have alleged they were pressured or even tortured into leaving the party, while many others who stayed in the party have remained in jail. PTI candidates who have still managed to stand say they have been prevented from holding rallies and their posters are systematically torn down.

The election commission also ruled the party was not allowed to use its widely recognised symbol, the cricket bat, a devastating blow in a country with a high rate of illiteracy where the party symbol is how candidates are mostly identified. Without a unified symbol, many PTI candidates, including Hafeez, have also been forced by the election commission to officially stand as independents.

While in power, Khan's mishandling of the economy and crackdown on his political opponents drew heavy criticism and lost him widespread credibility. Since being removed from office, however, Khan's populist rhetoric is seen to have heavily polarised the electorate, while the crackdown he has endured has only served to drive up his popularity.

On the streets of Lahore and Islamabad there was a mood of defiance among voters and anti-military sentiments ran high as many felt the outcome of the election was already fixed by the generals.

Riaz Hussain, an interior designer in Lahore, was jailed for eight months after he was picked up by police and wrongly accused of taking part in violent PTI protests, but said he would still be voting for Khan's party.

'I will vote for Imran Khan and so will everyone I know,' he said. 'He is the most honest and trustworthy leader in Pakistan. But we are facing a brazen crackdown before the general elections. I personally know many innocent people are still behind the bars. If we say we will vote for Khan, we will be arrested immediately.'

Shahzad Ali had a poster of Sharif outside his cafe to appease the authorities, but said in reality he would be voting for PTI. 'Me and all my friends will vote for Khan. But Nawaz Sharif will win because the military want him to win and he has support from the police, military and entire government. The military decide the result,' he said.

With conventional campaigning largely obstructed, PTI have instead turned to innovative methods of campaigning using social media platforms including YouTube, X, Facebook and TikTok, an increasingly strategic way to reach out to Pakistan's voters, 67% of whom are between the ages of 18 and 45.

This includes creating three AI-generated video speeches to make it appear as if Khan was addressing voters even as he sat in jail.

The first speech was broadcast at one of PTI's online rallies, which was streamed live across all their social media channels to a watching audience of over 6 million people, in which Khan spoke out against the crackdown on PTI and told audiences that 'history will remember your sacrifices'. Though the internet was shut down in Pakistan as the online event was taking place, PTI estimates that over 20 million people have now watched the speech.

It was such a success that two more Khan AI-speeches were generated, based on shorthand notes given to his lawyers: one discussing the war in Gaza at an international conference and another, created just a few days before the election, in which Khan urged people to come out and vote in large numbers.

With physical rallies made largely impossible, the party has also been holding weekly 'virtual jalsas [rallies]' on social media, including two TikTok rallies that drew upwards of 16 million likes. A tool was also built on Facebook where voters can directly message Khan to ask about their local PTI candidate, and receive a personalised response.

Jibran Ilyas, PTI's head of social media, said even as the state had attempted to shut down many of these online campaigning methods, 'in this day and age, they can not stop the flow of information'.

'The crackdown on our party has only forced us to innovate even more, and I can see from our data how many people in Pakistan are seeking out information about their PTI candidates,' said Ilyas. 'We are doing out best to get the highest turnout in the history of Pakistan and I'm optimistic that will bring us back to power.'",theguardian.com,60,4,GB,en,"Hannah Ellis-Petersen,Shah Meer Baloch",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/962f8e3ec1dc83a83af5e1a272f2e66a8637ba67/954_387_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fa81714cc95caeb2e9de1c59a122031,False,@guardian,2.5941777,4a5917bf4c3228adfb115b340f9ecefe,"['Pakistan', 'election', 'PTI', 'crackdown', 'military']","PTI alleges a crackdown by the state's machinery to prevent them from participating in Pakistan's elections, with PTI candidates facing harassment, arrests, and false cases.

‘Reckless': Proposed ban on US funding for UNRWA raises alarm,Jillian Kestler-D'Amours,2024-02-07 19:49:05,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/reckless-proposed-ban-on-us-funding-for-unrwa-raises-alarm,aljazeera.com,Advocates say growing bipartisan support for curbs to UN agency for Palestinian refugees is ‘concerning' and ‘reckless'.,"A United States 
security bill
 that would curtail funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees is raising alarm, as rights advocates say a years-long effort to dismantle the agency is gaining steam amid Israel's war on Gaza.


The proposed $118bn legislation, a draft of which (
PDF
) was blocked in the US Senate on Wednesday, includes a provision prohibiting Washington from allocating any funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
list of 3 items
list 1 of 3
list 2 of 3
list 3 of 3
end of list


Seth Binder, advocacy director at the Middle East Democracy Center, said this would apply to humanitarian assistance included in the bill as well as any previously approved funds for UNRWA that have not yet been allocated, a sum totalling about $300,000.


'It's unclear … where and how this specific provision may become law, if it ever is able to,' Binder told Al Jazeera. 'But it is concerning nonetheless just given recent developments.'


UNRWA came under renewed scrutiny last month after the Israeli government 
accused
 around a dozen of the agency's more than 13,000 Gaza employees of taking part in Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7, which killed a reported 1,139 people.
 
UNRWA immediately 
sacked
 the employees in question and announced that it was opening a probe into the allegations, which it described as 'shocking' and 'serious'. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 
also has appointed
 an independent panel to investigate.


Israel has yet to provide evidence to back up its allegations, but 
the US and several other countries
 quickly suspended funding to the agency as a result. UNRWA relies on government contributions to fund its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.


Against that backdrop, the Senate bill — which had the support of President Joe Biden — reflected growing bipartisan acceptance of what previously were Republican-driven attempts to curtail 
UNRWA
, said Ethan Mayer-Rich at the Arab Center Washington DC.


'We're seeing a pretty quick departure from what used to be a split down party lines,' he told Al Jazeera. 'It's reckless, and ultimately I think history is going to see [the US] as being completely complicit in what is unquestionably an incredibly tragic and dire situation.'


Mayer-Rich, the centre's liaison for US government affairs, added that 'the conversation in part is guided by the Biden administration'.


'We've seen, at this point, an endorsement by the highest level of office that it's OK for Democrats to call into question UNRWA's mandate, to call into question the necessity of its mission, which has long been a Republican-guided effort,' he said.


'This is a message that will have a durable impact on the way that Democrats are talking about UNRWA and the necessary services it provides.'

‘A huge hole'


Indeed, current attempts in the US to defund UNRWA come at a critical time.


The agency is leading humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza, where Israel's military bombardment has killed more than 27,708 Palestinians and caused wide-scale destruction since October 7.


Palestinians in the besieged enclave also face dire food, water and medical shortages. The local healthcare system is near total collapse, and more than 1.7 million people have been internally displaced. Many families have sought shelter at UNRWA-run facilities.


Since the Biden administration announced its UNRWA funding freeze in late January, top UN officials — as well as human rights advocates and humanitarian aid groups — have issued multiple pleas asking Washington to reconsider.


The US previously provided 
$422m to the agency
 in 2023, making it UNRWA's largest contributor. Those funds accounted for nearly 30 percent of UNRWA's contributions last year, explained Bill Deere, director of the agency's Washington representative office.


'If this proposal were to become law, that's a huge hole that would have to be filled,' Deere told Al Jazeera in an email, referring to the Senate bill.
 
If this proposal were to become law that's a huge hole that would have to be filled,' Deere told Al Jazeera in an email, referring to the Senate bill.


The legislation, which included more than $14bn in additional US security assistance to Israel, had the backing of the White House, but it is unlikely to reach Biden's desk to be signed into law, particularly after Wednesday's setback in the Senate.


Top Republicans 
have also said
 it will be 'dead on arrival' if it reaches the House of Representatives, amid calls for stricter immigration measures.


Still, Deere — who described the atmosphere in Washington as a 'challenging policy environment' — said the bill 'demonstrates that we need to keep discussing with lawmakers the fact that UNRWA and the UN have acted swiftly and decisively in the wake of the recent news'.


He also warned that the agency 'will have a very hard time operating beyond March 1st if donor states do not resume their support' and stressed that UNRWA operates beyond Gaza alone.


'Hundreds of thousands of Palestine refugees in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan will lose access to primary healthcare, direct food support, rental assistance, and education,' Deere said. 'Human decency aside, such an occurrence also poses a regional stability issue.'


Reinvigorated pressure


But despite those warnings, Republicans have seized on the accusations against UNRWA to reinvigorate a years-long effort to stymie the agency. 'This is something that they've long been trying to do, and they've really seized the moment,' said Mayer-Rich.


At least 
seven pieces of legislation
 aimed at defunding or disbanding UNRWA have been introduced by the Republicans in Congress since Israel's allegations were made public, according to a tally by the Arab Center Washington DC.


Republican legislators 
held
 a subcommittee hearing last week titled, 'UNRWA Exposed: Examining the Agency's Mission and Failures'.


And a group of nearly two dozen Republican senators had called for legislation to include 'an immediate and permanent prohibition' on US assistance to UNRWA. 'The United States must permanently stop all contributions to UNRWA,' they said (

) on January 31.


The push comes less than six years after former Republican President Donald Trump 
ended
 US assistance to the agency in 2018, 
saying
 that Washington was shouldering a 'very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA's costs'.


That move — widely seen as part of the Trump administration's hardline, pro-Israel stance — 
crippled
 UNRWA's operations. Biden restored 
funding
 in 2021.
 
Tariq Kenney-Shawa, US policy fellow at Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said Israel and its allies in the US have attacked UNRWA for decades in an effort to weaken the right of Palestinian refugees to return to what is now Israel, a long-standing demand.


'What Republicans would like to see is a dismantling and defunding of UNRWA so that the Palestinian refugee ‘problem' can fade into the annals of history,' he told Al Jazeera.


While Republicans have historically been the 'loudest voices' pressuring UNRWA, Kenney-Shawa explained that staunch support for Israel in the US is bipartisan. Some establishment Democrats last month quickly called to cut funding to the agency, too, following the recent allegations.


He also noted the timing of the accusations against UNRWA and the US funding cut, just hours after the International Court of Justice 
determined
 on January 26 that Israel was 'plausibly' committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.


'Representatives of 
the [Biden] administration
 have themselves emphasised the critical role that UNRWA plays in providing aid and support for Palestinian refugees and Palestinians in need,' Kenney-Shawa said.


'But at the same time, I think their larger concern is providing cover for Israel at any cost — and I think that cost is Palestinian refugees and is UNRWA.'


US to ‘redirect' funding


Though the Senate bill is unlikely to pass in its current form, the UNRWA provision continues to raise alarm.


The US State Department acknowledged this week that the Biden administration is looking into other ways to support humanitarian efforts in Gaza because the legislation contains language that would block its ability to fund the agency.


Spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on Monday that Washington plans to 'redirect funding for UNRWA to other partners to provide assistance in Gaza', including to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP).


The Senate bill included $1.4bn of humanitarian assistance for Gaza, Patel said. 'This is tangible money that we believe will save lives and have a direct impact on Palestinian civilians.'

However, the leaders of several UN agencies — including UNICEF and the WFP — 
said
 last week that suspending funds for UNRWA would have 'catastrophic consequences' because 'no other entity has the capacity to deliver' what is needed in Gaza.


The International Rescue Committee and other humanitarian groups also 
said
, 'UNRWA's humanitarian role in this crisis is indispensable and cannot remotely be replaced by any other aid organization'.


According to Kenney-Shawa, the future of UNRWA funding in the US right now largely hinges on the political will of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party.


'If the Biden administration is truly committed to the provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, like they on paper say they are, then there are avenues to push back against Republicans and make sure there is no provision within these proposed bills that automatically just cuts funding outright,' he said.


But that appears unlikely, Kenney-Shawa explained, because it would mean standing up to Republicans and 
pro-Israel lobby groups
 in an election year — and possibly appearing to challenge Israel.


'I think the Republicans are, as always, … seizing the opportunity to kind of put the Biden administration between a rock and a hard place, knowing full well that, at the end of the day, the Biden administration is going to side with Israel.'

Good morning,

For Gen-Z, TikTok is not just for personal experiences—it's also a platform for career advice. There are more than 2.6 million posts with the hashtag #WorkLife, including videos that show a day in the life at major employers like Deloitte or Google.

Now, Handshake, a job search platform most associated with college students, is launching an interface that operates like a social media feed, and new video features that allow companies to reach prospective employees. While employers have hopped on the TikTok trend, it can be hard for candidates to find those videos, and Garrett Lord, Handshake's cofounder and CEO, hopes the platform will 'level the information playing field.'

The idea is to provide job seekers with a more engaging view of the companies they're applying to than a standard job posting.

ESPN, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. are coming together to create a new sports streaming service — a move that will add another platform in the already-crowded streaming wars. The new platform will include major college and professional sporting events, including NFL, NBA, MLB, College Sports, UFC, the FIFA World Cup and more, as sports migrate to the streaming world amid falling cable television viewership.

The metal door plug that flew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 in midair last month was opened at a Boeing factory and reinstalled without several key bolts, federal investigators found, as the airplane manufacturer faces intense pressure over safety concerns. In response to the report, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told CNN 'Boeing is accountable for what happened,' and FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told a House panel Tuesday the agency will 'have more boots on the ground closely scrutinizing and monitoring' Boeing's production and manufacturing.

After his tumultuous departure in 2019, WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann is reportedly aiming to buy back his now-bankrupt former company along with billionaire Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point. Neumann, who remains a billionaire and has since founded other real estate ventures since leaving WeWork, did not disclose how much money he would put up for the company, but his lawyers also said they have faced resistance from WeWork.

UPS stock notched its best single-day gain since February 2022 after UBS analysts upgraded their rating of the limping shipping magnate. The analysts expressed optimism about UPS' profit outlook as it cuts costs, announcing last week it will lay off 12,000 employees. Still, UPS has far underperformed the broader market in recent years.

In less than a decade, Taiwan-born engineer and IBM veteran Lisa Su turned the struggling Advanced Micro Devices into a darling of the chip industry, and a $287 billion (market capitalization) enterprise. Now, the tech-stock rally of 2024 has made Su—the first female chief executive of a major semiconductor company — one of just 26 self-made U.S. women billionaires.

MORE: Su is also part of a small subset of so-called hired-hand billionaires, who are neither founders nor heirs. Forbes has found just 26 people who were hired as executives—sometimes as junior employees, sometimes as CEOs—who became billionaires, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

Meta will begin labeling AI-generated images on Facebook and Instagram 'in the coming months,' and called for 'common technical standards' to identify such content ahead of a historic global election year. On Monday, Meta's Oversight Board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, called for the company to rework its 'incoherent' policy on manipulated media after upholding a decision that allows an altered video of President Joe Biden to remain on Facebook.

Investors have ditched one-time favorite Tesla for Eli Lilly, as the early days of the long-established pharmaceutical giant's diabetes and weight loss drugs deliver explosive profits. Tesla is now worth $110 billion less than Eli Lilly, and is the S&P's worst-performing stock of 2024, while Eli Lilly is the fifth-best, leading some market observers to question whether Eli Lilly usurped Tesla as a member of the 'magnificent seven' leading U.S. stocks.

MONEY + POLITICS

A federal appeals court shut down former President Donald Trump's claims of 'absolute immunity' and refused to dismiss charges against him in his federal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election, paving the way for the case to go to trial. The three-judge panel ruled that for this criminal case, 'former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant.' Trump is expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

Brands are pulling out all the stops to generate buzz ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl, with 125,000 people expected to attend this week's roster of fan events in Las Vegas and 100 million tuning in on television. Behind the scenes, however, there is an equally elaborate series of events and activations aimed at a much more exclusive audience of business partners and C-suite executives, with the goal of retaining key clients and, ideally, laying the foundation for new business.

Spotify blew past its premium subscription goals with the addition of 10 million paid users last quarter, the company announced, bringing it to a total of 236 million paying customers. That makes it the clear winner in the music streaming space amid competitors like YouTube Music, SiriusXM and Pandora, though it's not clear how many people subscribe to Apple or Amazon's music streaming services.

Eli Lilly reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results and revised its 2024 sales forecasts upwards. The report was buoyed by strong sales and higher prices of Mounjaro, the company's blockbuster diabetes drug, which raked in $2.2 billion, as well as the launch of Zepbound, its newly-approved weight loss drug, which pulled in $175.8 million. Zepbound is widely expected to become one of the best-selling drugs of all time.

TRAVEL + LIFESTYLE

One month after a cabin door panel blew out of a Boeing 737 Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight, nearly all Max 9s are back in the air, the FAA said Monday. But the three-week grounding of the jets took a financial toll on Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, the only two U.S. carriers that operate them, and public confidence in Boeing has taken a significant hit.

A new proposal introduced in the House of Representatives would double the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for married couples, which taxpayers—largely in blue states like New Jersey, New York and Virginia—have long complained about. But the cap would only be increased for the 2023 tax year, and starting in 2024, would revert to $10,000 for all taxpayers, set by the 2017 tax bill signed by President Donald Trump, until it expires at the end of 2025.

DAILY COVER STORY

TOPLINE American shoppers at Amazon, Walmart, Etsy and grocery delivery apps Instacart and Uber Eats may have unwittingly bought canned tomatoes and pastes produced by Uyghur forced laborers in China's far west region of Xinjiang, which are banned by the U.S. government, according to a Forbes review of product listings.

Tomatoes and cotton grown in the region were banned by the U.S. government starting in January 2021, and a new law barring all goods from Xinjiang kicked in from June 2022. The bans are a reaction to mass detention centers in the region, where Human Rights Watch say up to half a million people from the region's mostly Muslim minority group have been detained and forced to labor in farms and factories.

Since the 2022 ban was imposed under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, U.S. officials have seized more than $2.2 billion of goods at American ports they believed were produced by Uyghur forced labor.

Despite this, Forbes found examples of canned tomatoes and pastes from Chinese companies with links to Xinjiang on sale with major online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and via online grocery delivery apps Instacart and Uber Eats using data from Israeli startup Ultra Information Solution's digital vetting platform Publican.

Tomato brands Nina, Gino and Zehrat Safa, which have been stocked by third-party sellers operating on Amazon, Walmart and Etsy's marketplaces, are produced by the Chinese company Hebei Tomato Industry. The food processor, which is based around 200 miles southwest of China's capital Beijing, states on its website that 'raw materials come from Xinjiang'' and boasts of the region's sunshine and climate. Hebei Tomato did not respond to a comment request by press time.

Amazon spokesperson Jennifer Flag said the company complies with the law and that 'whenever we find or receive proof of forced labor, we take action and remove that product and may suspend privileges to sell.' Some of the product listings of the banned tomatoes were still live as of publication.

WHY IT MATTERS President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law in December 2021. This act took a harder line than earlier orders, and Treasury sanctions, by putting the onus on importers to prove that any product from the Xinjiang region had no ties to forced labor.

American lawmakers from the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party last month called on the Biden Administration to step up its enforcement of the law.

FACTS AND COMMENTS

Investigators announced a sweeping corruption probe against 70 New York City Housing Authority employees Tuesday, as investigators accused building managers of taking bribes for simple repairs. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York called it the largest single day corruption bust in the Department of Justice's history:

Under $10,000: The cost of the small-scale repairs and maintenance, which the NYCHA employees allegedly took a portion of, usually in the range of $500 to $2,000, according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams

Over $2 million: How much the bribes amounted to over the course of the investigation, per the DOJ

One-third: The share of the city's 335 public housing developments across all five boroughs where the practice occurred, prosecutors said

STRATEGY AND SUCCESS

'Loud budgeting' is all the rage in 2024, at least according to TikTok. The trend involves being vocal about your financial needs, and enables you to say no to peer pressure around spending money. The idea, like with Dry January, is if you are public about your goals, others won't try to sabotage you. Ultimately, it allows you to take greater control of your decisions today to prioritize your future self.

The Guardian view on public service queues: a grim symbol of chronic underinvestment,Editorial,2024-02-07 18:35:49,full,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-public-service-queues-a-grim-symbol-of-chronic-underinvestment,theguardian.com,Editorial: Conservatives fretting about 'the nanny state' have failed to see people's desperate need for compassionate government,"T
he capacity to form an orderly queue is sometimes held up as an admirable quality of the British character, perhaps from historical association with rationing and stoical patience in wartime. But the queue is also an emblem of failure. A famous political advert that 
helped propel Margaret Thatcher
 to power in 1979 depicted a line of people waiting to be seen by an unemployment office under the slogan 'Labour isn't working'. Now it is Conservative government that plainly isn't working, and the queue is for public services. Many people were appalled, but perhaps not surprised, by scenes of queues 
that lasted three days
 this week 
as would-be patients tried
 to register at a new NHS dental surgery in Bristol.
On Wednesday, Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, announced an emergency funding package, offering dentists £50 for every new NHS patient taken on. The British Dental Association 
dismisses this
 as 'rearranging the deckchairs'. Labour, which identified dentistry as an area of critical concern at the start of the year, promises a more substantial expansion of provision.
It isn't just dentistry. Rishi Sunak 
admitted in a TV interview
 broadcast this week that he was failing to keep a promise to bring down waiting lists across the NHS. The prime minister disingenuously identified industrial action as the main obstacle to progress. The truth, as Mr Sunak knows but cannot express, is that waiting lists for planned treatments started growing in 2013, long before doctors went on strike and long before the Covid pandemic that ministers also routinely cite as the cause of all woes in the health service. Mr Sunak was not yet an MP when the seeds of the current crisis in public services were sown. But it is his party that is responsible, his government that is failing to get a grip, and his Conservative creed that prohibits a candid recognition of the underlying problem.
The UK state is crumbling through sustained underinvestment and a myopic political fixation on cutting spending without regard for long-term social consequences. Although notionally NHS spending was 'ringfenced' in George Osborne's austerity budgets, inflation of medical costs meant the same resources were stretched ever thinner. Meanwhile, the evisceration of non-ringfenced budgets increased the burden on frontline care. Local government was hit especially hard and lost much of its capacity for public health provision.
The advertised benefits of austerity – eliminating deficits and reducing reliance on public borrowing – did not materialise. The Tories were committed to reach a surplus on the state's day-to-day budget by 2014-15. It didn't happen until 
November
 2017. Tory ministers cite unforeseeable extraneous factors for their fiscal failure. In the case of 
monetary finance
 to fund deficits through the pandemic, that is a reasonable defence.
But the underlying structural fault is refusal to conceive of public spending as investment that can yield economic efficiency by enabling a healthier, more productive society. The path of public spending needs to be explained. But Britain has engaged in masochistic austerity, driven by ideological aversion to activist government. Even now, when Britain's public infrastructure is visibly derelict and people are queueing round the block to access services, Tory MPs deride public health interventions as the pernicious meddling of the '
nanny state

Children's emergency mental health referrals in England soar by 53%,Andrew Gregory,2024-02-07 00:01:04,full,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/07/childrens-emergency-mental-health-referrals-in-england-soar-by-53,theguardian.com,"NHS data exposing a ‘devastating explosion' of mental illness should be a ‘wake-up call' for the government, MPs and health leaders say","The number of children referred to emergency mental healthcare in England has soared by more than 50% in three years, according to data laying bare the impact of lengthy waiting lists for regular 
NHS
 treatment.
There were 32,521 emergency and urgent referrals to child and adolescent 
mental health
 services crisis teams in 2022-23, analysis of official data by the Royal College of Psychiatrists revealed. In 2019-20, the year before the Covid pandemic, the figure was 21,242.
The increase means more than 600 mentally ill children a week are deteriorating to such a state that they have reached crisis point.
Many of the children requiring emergency care – some suicidal or seriously ill as a result of eating disorders – have been stuck on waiting lists for an average of five months, and in the worst cases as long as two years, the college said.
MPs and health leaders said the 
NHS
 figures exposed a 'devastating explosion' of untreated severe mental ill health among children, and should be a wake-up call for the government. There was now a serious risk that the alarming surge in children reaching crisis point before being able to access help was becoming 'the new norm', they added.
'No one should have to watch their child's mental health deteriorate while they wait for care,' the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Lade Smith, told the Guardian. 'It's completely unacceptable that this is the reality facing so many families.'
Ministers must take urgent action to provide targeted support to every child in need of mental healthcare and 'turn the tide' on the country's growing children's mental health crisis, Smith said.
'We want to provide young people with effective care as soon as they need it, not once they've already developed a serious illness which could have been prevented,' she added.
'That's why we need to see government focus on prevention and reversing the rising rates of mental illness, as well as ensuring sufficient resourcing of specialist services.'
Record numbers of children and young people are seeking help for mental health problems. In 2022 alone, 
1.4 million were referred to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs)
 for treatment of anxiety, depression, eating disorders and other psychological problems.
But as demand soars for children's mental healthcare and support, Camhs teams are struggling to see or treat children quickly enough. Experts say that is leading to thousands of under-18s getting even sicker while on waiting lists, prompting a 53% rise in emergency and urgent referrals for Camhs crisis care.
An emergency referral is normally made if a child needs to be seen within 24 hours. They might be a risk to themselves due to suicidal feelings, have a significant health risk because of an illness such as anorexia or have another serious mental health condition, experts said.
Emergency referrals to Camhs are mostly made by GPs and doctors in A&E departments, which are seeing rising numbers of mentally ill children arrive with nowhere else to turn, although schools and social services can also do so.
Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the college's child and adolescent faculty, said: 'It's unacceptable that so many children and young people are reaching crisis point before they are able to access care. We cannot allow this to become the new norm.
'Severe mental illness is not just an adult problem. The need for specialist mental health services for children and young people is growing all the time.'
Many of the conditions arising in children could be prevented or treated if prompt support and access to care were available, Lockhart said.
'The evidence shows us that children who receive support quickly are less likely to develop long-term conditions that negatively affect their education, social development and health in later life.
'Government and integrated care boards must commit to reducing the rate of mental illness among children by setting an achievable target. This needs to be backed by an expansion of the mental health workforce and additional funding for services.'
The college welcomed last year's government announcement of an extra £5m to improve access to early support hubs for people aged 11 to 25.
But it said an extra £125m to £205m would be needed to establish hubs in every local authority, with running costs of at least £114m a year.
'Every young person should be able to access the help they need when they need it,' said Laura Bunt, the chief executive of YoungMinds, a children's mental health charity. 'The government must prioritise young people's mental health and make it much easier for them to get support.'
Daisy Cooper MP, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said: 'This devastating explosion of mental ill health among children should be a wake-up call for the government. Conservative ministers have neglected children's mental health during and after the pandemic, leaving mental health services and families in crisis.'
NHS England said it was treating more young people than ever before, and was expanding mental health services as quickly as possible to meet increasing demand.
A spokesperson said: 'Early support for children and young people with mental health issues is a priority for the NHS, and plans are in place to ensure more than one in two pupils and learners in schools and colleges are covered by an NHS mental health support team by spring 2025 – significantly ahead of the original target.'
The Department of 
Health
 and Social Care said it was determined to support children with their mental health, and was investing an extra £2.3bn a year into NHS mental health services.
'This funding will also help expand the number of mental health support teams in schools to reach at least 50% of pupils in England by the end of March 2025,' a spokesperson added.",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Andrew Gregory,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce7ac3b147eaea7cc078acea072dd0c0d9e16df9/0_171_5119_3072/master/5119.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39b303b567d8b4c1658d97435a890b7c,False,@guardian,11.668049,7d2642776ae441669394cb98dd8d7b93,"['emergency mental healthcare', 'waiting lists', 'child and adolescent mental health services', ""children's mental health crisis""]","The number of children referred to emergency mental healthcare in England has increased by over 50% in three years due to lengthy waiting lists for regular NHS treatment, with more than 600 mentally ill children a week reaching crisis point.

"Frailty in older people rose sharply during austerity years, study reveals",Andrew Gregory,2024-02-07 19:00:50,full,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/07/frailty-in-older-people-rose-sharply-during-austerity-years-study-reveals,theguardian.com,Cuts to health spending brought in by Cameron government associated with steeper declines in wellbeing than in previous decade,"Austerity cuts to the NHS, public health and social care in England have been linked with a sharp increase in frailty, in the first study of its kind.
The coalition government's austerity programme in the early 2010s is associated with steeper increases in frailty with age compared with the pre-austerity years between 2002 and 2010, the study led by the University of Edinburgh shows. The findings were published 
in the journal Plos One
.
More people living with frailty means that relatively minor health problems, such as urinary tract infections, are likely to have a greater effect on the population's long-term health and wellbeing. Frailty is generally characterised by issues such as reduced muscle strength and fatigue.
Previous research
 had found that a slowdown in improvements in life expectancy coincided with the government's sharp cuts to health and social care funding after David Cameron came to power more than a decade ago. However, the mechanism through which drastic cuts were associated with decreased life expectancy had been unclear until now.
In the new study, researchers analysed data on the frailty index, which captures age-related declines in functional ability and physical and mental health. The analysis included more than 16,000 people enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2002-2018, with an average age of 67.
Researchers found that frailty index scores increased more rapidly with age after the implementation of austerity policies. This was the case for all population groups, across genders and socioeconomic groups, but was particularly so for the oldest people in England.
'Compared to the 2000s, we found that older people in England were becoming more frail, more quickly during the 2010s, and that frailty was particularly common in the poorest in society,' the researchers wrote. 'Our work is another warning about the possible impacts of austerity on the health of an ageing nation.'
Prof Adam Gordon, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the findings showed how the number of people living with frailty had increased sharply since austerity began.
'As frontline healthcare professionals, we see every day how social isolation, the inability to get out, to exercise and to eat well, impact upon health and wellbeing of older people,' he said. 'Older people with frailty are more likely to need the help of health and social care services. In emergency departments, those over the age of 80 have seen their average wait times double, more than for any other age group.'
People living with frailty also face the longest waiting lists for elective surgery, and for care in the community, Gordon said. 'Besides the suffering experienced by those involved, this is an example of how austerity can end up costing the nation more in the longer term.'
He added: 'We are desperately failing our parents and grandparents and this should be a source of national embarrassment. In this election year, it's essential that all major political parties have clear strategies for investment care and support services, not just for older people who already live with frailty, but for those at risk of developing it in the near future.'
Caroline Abrahams, Age UK's charity director, said frailty was often the all too visible yet frequently neglected feature of older people's health.
'Characterised by vulnerability to sudden changes and deterioration in health, frailty is often in the background of pressures across the 
NHS
 as older people are made to reach crisis point before getting any help,' she said. 'This includes needing emergency care, and avoidable stays in hospital for want of a decent package of social care or proactive support in the community.

'It is not surprising that when fewer services are available to the public, more older people experience frailty that could have been managed or even avoided. We've seen this again with the impact of the pandemic and cost of living crisis that have left older people without the services and support to stay well.'
Abrahams said frailty was avoidable and with the right support the condition could be improved or at the very least remain stable. 'Responding to that reality is critical for the future success of both NHS and social care and for the wellbeing of our older and ageing population,' she said.
Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: 'Fourteen years of the 
Conservatives
 hollowing out our public services has left our country weaker and less healthy. People's lives have been cut short and what should be their golden years are increasingly spent in pain and discomfort. Not only has this taken its toll on people's lives, an unhealthy society also means greater pressures and costs to the NHS.

AI doctors and chatbot nurses? Labour must show the future of the NHS isn't so dystopian,Jeni Tennison,2024-02-07 10:00:12,full,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-nurses-labour-nhs-tech,theguardian.com,"To reform the NHS, a new government will have to ignore self-serving tech companies – and engage a sceptical public instead, says data campaigner Jeni Tennison","T
he AI revolution is upon us, and Labour is hoping it could help rescue an 
NHS in crisis
. At a recent Institute for Government event, Karin Smyth, shadow minister for health, 
described how
 a Labour government will 'hold the door open' for tech companies. But the tech-utopian visions Labour is being sold are not cost free: they could fundamentally reshape our relationships with our doctors and our own health, and undermine the founding principles on which the NHS is built. While tech companies flog AI magic, civil society must act as a counterbalance to temper the hype and remind the NHS about what really matters.
The Tory government also hopes that unlocking '
the incredible power that [health] data possesses
' can drive innovation, reduce costs and improve healthcare. The optimism crosses the parliamentary divide. The consensus is based on a vision of AI's role in analysing medical health records and diagnostics, such as the 
early detection of Parkinson's
 from eye scans or the 'personalised AI doctor' extolled by the Tony Blair Institute in its 
recent report
. It encompasses a top-to-bottom transformation of the healthcare system: from chatbots in mental health apps, to waiting list prioritisation algorithms, to supporting the discovery of new medicines.
But while Labour cannot spend its way out of the NHS crisis, AI is no magic bullet either. Tech-utopian visions fail to consider the darker implications of AI. Dr Jess Morley, an NHS and AI expert, 
has warned
 that we need to manage potential unintended consequences to 'avoid a situation in which the NHS becomes a healthcare system that suits the algorithms but is not socially desirable or even acceptable'.
Hyping AI – as then 
health secretary Matt Hancock did
 with 
Babylon Health
 prior to its collapse – undermines public trust, which is needed for both the adoption of technology and the use of patient data that underpins it. 
Research conducted
 by my organisation, Connected by Data, with the campaign group 
Just Treatment
, revealed patients' deep concerns about the personal and ethical implications of the NHS's digital transformation. We need a different political conversation and vision for the role of AI in the NHS to address them.
For example, do we want the Tony Blair Institute's vision of personalised AI doctors to 'capture and track diverse data from an individual over their lifetime' and use this to 'make tailored treatment and lifestyle advice'? They could feel like an overbearing parent nagging us to take better care of ourselves, consequently making us start to discount how we actually feel, and so worry unnecessarily about our health.
Do we want doctors to become deskilled 'humans in the loop', mediating our encounters with AI systems? Or for triage nurses on 111 to be replaced by chatbots? Our relationships with medical professionals could unintentionally become datafied: reduced to a cold exchange of measurements and figures rather than the rich, human, caring encounters we value. Shouldn't our priority be to use AI to optimise 
NHS
 management and simplify administration rather than augmenting medical care?
The risks don't end there. Are we content for AI to leave behind the digitally excluded and mostly benefit the already privileged? There are well-known biases in the coverage and quality of 
health data and medical research
, as well as a difference in how easy it is to access this technology between genders, races and communities. More AI could mean more health inequalities.
These potential downsides of AI threaten the foundations of our healthcare system: our autonomy, doctor-patient relationships and universal access. But they are not inevitable. An NHS that is alert to the risks, and to preserving its founding principles, can avoid them.
This is where Labour has the opportunity to differentiate itself from Tory tech solutionism. The current government shies away from robust challenge and runs 
engagement exercises
 oriented towards achieving public buy-in to plans the government 
already
 has in place. Labour should give the public, professionals and civil society a true opportunity to co-design the NHS's future with technology, including legal and political tools to support collective scrutiny.
Labour also needs to show leadership in demarcating the role of the private sector in the development and delivery of AI systems. The Tony Blair Institute advocates using public money and public data to grow the commercial biotech sector. But 
as we have seen with medicines
, the private sector has few qualms about putting profit above patient health.
Instead, 
Labour
 should commit to overhauling procurement processes in the health sector. It needs to equip the NHS to not just negotiate good value for money on AI, but renew its democratic roots. The NHS should be strategically investing in community-owned and open-source health technologies and putting in place independent ethical reviews and public oversight of large technology procurements to rebuild public trust.
AI has promise, but is not cost free. A Labour government will not just inherit a failing health service, but a set of risky technology deals and a sceptical public. As it seeks to reform the NHS, it must avoid being seduced by the self-serving promises of AI companies and instead give a powerful role to the public, medical professionals and civil society in shaping our future NHS.

Does Insurance Cover Therapy?,Erik Martin,2024-02-06 14:45:59,full,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/health-insurance/does-insurance-cover-therapy/,forbes.com,Health insurance typically covers mental health therapy but how much you pay for each session depends on the specific health insurance plan.,"Health insurance plans typically cover mental health treatment like talk therapy, inpatient hospitalization, substance abuse treatment, emergency care and medications. But your need for these services and pharmaceuticals must be deemed medically necessary, which requires a diagnosis.



The Affordable Care Act (ACA), sometimes called Obamacare, requires that health insurance plans include coverage for mental health and substance use disorders.

That applies to ACA plans and small group employer-sponsored health plans with 50 or fewer employees (except in California, Colorado, New York, and Vermont, which define small group health plans as employer-sponsored plans with 100 or fewer employees)

Many large employers still offer mental health coverage even if it's not required, according to Eric Calciano, lead employee benefits advisor with New City Insurance, an employee benefits consulting firm in San Diego.

Prior to the ACA law, a health insurance company that offered individual health insurance could turn you down because of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis or might have excluded mental health treatment from plan benefits.

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) is another law that helps people seeking mental health care. The MHPAEA, passed in 2008, requires insurers that offer mental health coverage for mental health/substance use disorder treatment that's equal to or better than a plan's medical health coverage.

For example: An insurer can't charge a $30 copay for an annual checkup with a primary care provider and then charge a $100 copay for a psychologist visit. This parity law also makes it more difficult for insurance companies to limit mental health-related appointments within a year.

Access to mental health coverage has improved over the past 20 years because of the Affordable Care Act and MHPAEA, but not everyone enjoys that access. 'While some health plans have made strides to close the coverage gaps that exist for mental health care in employer-sponsored plans, there is still a long way to go,' says Ben Simmons, chief health plan officer at Gravie, a health benefits company.

How Do I Know If My Insurance Covers Therapy?

Follow these steps to confirm that you have mental health treatment coverage in place:

Contact your health insurance company and request a copy of your summary of benefits and coverage document to review what's covered and how much you can anticipate paying toward your care. This document may also be available online via your insurer's member portal. 'Your plan information should tell you how much your copayment or coinsurance is for mental health services,' says Derek Lee, vice president of insurance operations for Grow Therapy, an online mental health platform.
If you have group health insurance through work, contact your HR department.
If you have an ACA marketplace plan, you can find out more about mental health benefits on healthcare.gov.
If you're on Medicare, get more details on mental health coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, contact your insurance company for more information about mental health benefits available to you.
If you're on Medicaid, learn more about behavioral health benefits on the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission.

Does Insurance Cover Online Therapy?

Many health plans cover telehealth mental health visits so that members can obtain online therapy or over the phone, says Calciano. SimplePractice, an electronic health records platform, reports that the fifth most common type of mental health service billed in 2022 was for a 45-minute telehealth visit. A 60-minute in-person visit topped the list of mental health-related claims.

The Covid crisis caused more people to seek therapy online versus in-person. Before the pandemic, insurers typically didn't cover or promote online therapy, preferring that members visit a behavioral health specialist in person. But that's changed. Almost two-thirds of all telehealth appointments in the fourth quarter of 2022 were for behavioral health, according to a Trilliant Health report.

The federal Health and Human Services says most insurance providers cover at least some form of telehealth services, including online therapy.

If you have Medicare, you can receive telehealth therapy at any location in the country through December 31, 2024, including your home. After that date, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) in order to have most telehealth services covered.

What Kinds of Treatments Are Typically Covered?

A wide range of mental health-related treatments like psychotherapy are covered by health insurance plans but there's an important caveat.

'Most plans cover mental health therapy so long as the therapy provider can diagnose the condition and document the medical necessity of the treatment,' says Dr. Carl Nassar, a licensed professional counselor in Fort Collins, Colorado.

'So, for example, if you visit a therapist because you are generally happy but would like to explore some existential dilemmas, you might have a hard time getting your insurance to cover it. But if you are struggling with diagnosable depression or anxiety and can demonstrate a medical necessity for treatment, you're almost certainly covered.'

Among the medically necessary treatments likely covered by your insurance plan are:

Emergency care: Mental health insurance typically includes coverage for emergency psychiatric care, also known as crisis intervention, which may extend to overdose treatment. The specific emergency services covered can vary by plan.
Inpatient hospitalization: This involves more intensive mental health treatment, whether voluntary or involuntary, within a hospital or facility. Patients receive continuous support through individual and group therapy, medication management and coping strategies.
Medications: Health insurance plans usually cover pharmaceutical treatment for mental health disorders.
Partial hospitalization. This is a less intensive alternative to full inpatient care. Individuals participate in a structured program of psychiatric treatments during the day but do not stay overnight in the facility.
Psychotherapy: Talk therapy encompasses various therapeutic approaches such as general counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy. If you engage in one-on-one sessions with a therapist or psychologist, insurance typically covers the session.
Substance abuse treatment: This therapy addresses drug and alcohol addiction through specific protocols. Health insurance plans may cover various interventions, including talk therapy, medication management, 12-step programs or medical detox for individuals undergoing substance abuse treatment.

Health plans may not cover every type of mental health services, though. You may be denied coverage for:

Addiction or mental health treatment deemed medically unnecessary.
Educational programs, like wilderness therapy, for addiction or mental health.
Experimental therapies.
Genetic testing for psychotropic medication.
Halfway houses.
Long-term mental health or addiction treatment.
Treatment requested by a third party, such as a school or employer.

How Much Does Therapy Cost?

The cost of therapy depends on whether you have health insurance and your specific health plan. If you have health insurance, the plan decides on your copay, which you pay at the time of your visit.

The mental health parity law requires that health plans that offer those services must be the same or better than other medical services. That means a copay for an outpatient mental health visit can't cost more than a typical medical office visit.

Most health plans come with a health insurance deductible, which you must pay before mental health coverage kicks in. After you've met your deductible, you may have to pay a percentage of costs for services, which is called coinsurance, in addition to copays.

'You may also want to call your insurance company if you are unclear on exactly what your plan covers and how much you'll need to pay out-of-pocket for mental health treatment,' Lee recommends.

Cost of Therapy With Insurance

Therapy costs an average of $21 for a copay for in-network care and $60 for out-of-network care, according to Psychology Today. The cost of therapy with insurance depends on your health plan's copay.

Cost of Therapy Without Insurance

If you don't have health insurance, you can expect to pay between $75 to $135 or more for a talk therapy visit, Calciano says.

Things get a lot more expensive when you lack mental health treatment coverage or health insurance in general. 'Many therapists don't even accept health insurance and can charge upward of $200 per session,' says Lee.

There may be other options if you lack mental health coverage.

'Many individuals are eligible for no-cost Medicaid coverage or subsidized coverage through the ACA marketplace based on income,' says Calciano. 'For those who still don't qualify for coverage, there are often state and county-level programs to provide low- or no-cost treatment options for those in need. Consult your local social services office for help in getting the right care.'

Nassar adds that you may also find colleges that offer training programs providing therapy at very low costs.

"Premature deaths of hundreds of homeless Australians ‘completely unacceptable', housing minister says",Christopher Knaus,2024-02-06 14:00:37,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/homeless-people-premature-deaths-australia-data-release-housing-minister-julie-collins,theguardian.com,Comments from Julie Collins come in response to Guardian Australia investigation and as advocates push for new ways to monitor crisis,"The federal housing minister, Julie Collins, has described hundreds of premature homelessness deaths as 'completely unacceptable' amid a sector-wide push for the establishment of a reporting scheme to shine a light on the crisis.

Guardian Australia this week published the findings of a 12-month investigation of 627 homelessness deaths, finding a three-decade life expectancy gap and an average age of death of 44, and widespread systemic failings across the housing, health and justice systems.

The findings triggered immediate action from the homelessness sector. The Council to Homeless Persons wrote to the Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, urging new rules to mandate the reporting of homelessness deaths to the coroner.

The council's letter, citing the Guardian investigation, described the premature deaths as 'unacceptable' and said mandatory coronial reporting would allow governments to understand the true scale of the crisis.

'Without accurate statistics we are swimming against a rising tide of deaths plaguing our most vulnerable,' Deborah Di Natale, the council's chief executive, wrote. 'More Victorians will die unnecessarily unless we understand what is fuelling these tragedies.'

In Western Australia, Jesse Noakes, a longtime housing advocate and campaigner with Stop Evicting Families, said the state government should create a mandatory coronial reporting scheme and cease its dismissal of the pioneering work of Prof Lisa Wood, an academic whose team monitors homelessness deaths in Perth. The government has questioned the accuracy of Wood's research on rough sleeper deaths in Perth.

'If they don't like Lisa's numbers they should start keeping their own, and make every homeless death a reportable death subject to coronial inquest like deaths in custody,' he said. 'The state has just as much responsibility for people dying on its streets as in its jails.'

Q&A What is the 'Out in the cold' investigation? Show The deaths of Australians experiencing homelessness are largely invisible. No government in the country attempts to count or understand what is driving them, putting us at odds with other western nations. In an attempt to shine a light on this crisis, Guardian Australia has spent 12 months identifying and investigating 627 homelessness deaths. The investigation involved analysis of more than a decade of non-public death reports to state and territory coroners, a review of inquest findings since 2010, and dozens of interviews with rough sleepers, victims' families, researchers and advocates. The Guardian has found that, on average, people experiencing homelessness are dying at an average age of 44. That is vastly premature and a life expectancy gap of more than three decades. It is the first time the life expectancy gap has been measured at a national level and, despite the data's limitations, the finding is broadly in line with studies in Perth and Sydney. The investigation also found suicide and overdose, known as deaths of despair, are primary drivers of death. Researchers say such deaths are inextricably linked to the despair and hopelessness of homelessness. The investigation identified a wide range of systemic failings contributing to deaths, including gaps in health and mental healthcare, the critical undersupply of public housing and failures of the justice system. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

National Shelter and the Australian Alliance to End Homelessness also called for better reporting mechanisms to track and understand deaths, while the independent senator David Pocock said it should trigger a doubling of the Housing Australia Future Fund to boost social and affordable housing supply.

'This week we learned, thanks to some profound investigative work by the Guardian, that homeless Australians are dying on our streets at an average age of 44 years old, younger than most of the people in this place and little more than half the life span of the average Australian,' he told the Senate.

'This is a disgrace in a country like Australia, but it's also a by-product of how we've come to treat housing as a country: less as a fundamental human right, as something that everyone in our community should be able to afford, and more as a wealth creation vehicle.'

The AAEH had urged the former government in 2021 to take a lead role in monitoring and reporting on homelessness deaths, but it declined to act, setting Australia apart from other western nations that routinely report on homelessness deaths.

Collins, the housing and homelessness minister, said she was in discussions about better data collection with the states and territories.

She said the Guardian investigation would inform those discussions. 'The shocking number of Australians who have passed away while experiencing homelessness is completely unacceptable,' she said.

Collins did not commit to leading the creation of a homelessness deaths reporting scheme but said the government had given $2bn to states and territories to build 4,000 new social homes, provided $67.5m in additional homelessness funding and was continuing work on a national housing and homelessness plan and national housing and homelessness agreement with the states and territories, which is due to be finalised this year.

Jason Russell, a former firefighter who slept rough in Sydney and Melbourne over a period spanning 25 years, said shining a light on the deaths of people experiencing homelessness was crucial, to understand their circumstances and to reduce stigma.

'If they're going to leave this world with nothing, can't we just give them a little bit of dignity? Can't we at least keep a tally? We have tallies for how many people die from cigarettes,' he said. 'You don't know their journey, we all end up dying … but the way we die, alone, passed out – a sick dog gets more attention than someone who is homeless.

'We're not asking for front page news. It's just a tally.'

Russell now advocates on homelessness issues for the Council to Homeless Persons.

He said rough sleeper deaths were commonplace during his period of homelessness, beginning in Sydney in the mid-1990s.

'A lot of them were dying at night,' he said. 'I was terrified to sleep … I lost count of the number of spots I was in where you'd wake up and someone was dead.'

The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said the homelessness deaths were an 'indictment on the spending choices of Labor and Liberal governments'.

'The shortage of public and affordable housing in Australia is over 750,000 and still under Labor's housing plan the shortage will get worse,' he said. 'Until Labor agrees to invest in public housing the way governments used to, we'll never fix this crisis.'

Parklea private prison in spotlight after second suspected suicide in as many months,Catie McLeod,2024-02-07 00:21:05,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/parklea-private-prison-in-spotlight-after-second-suspected-suicide-in-as-many-months,theguardian.com,Exclusive: NSW government is deciding whether Sydney jail should be returned to public hands in 2026,"A second inmate has died in a suspected suicide at Sydney's Parklea correctional centre in as many months, adding to pressure on the 
New South Wales
 government as it considers the future of the troubled private prison.
The 53-year-old man died at Parklea on Saturday morning half an hour after prison officers found him unresponsive in his cell and tried to revive him, a spokesperson for operator MTC Australia said.
As with all deaths in custody, there would be a coronial inquest and an investigation by Corrective Services NSW and the police, MTC said.
The man's death follows that of another inmate at the privately run jail in Sydney's north-western suburbs in January. He was also believed to have killed himself.
The Minns government is deciding whether to 
renew MTC's contract
 to run the mixed-security men's prison and remand centre. Labor has already vowed to return one of the state's largest prisons – Junee correctional centre – 
to public ownership
 in 2025.
The corrections minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said 'one death in custody is too many' but it was 'important not to speculate' until the coroner had investigated.
'My thoughts are with the deceased man's family and any victims who may be reliving their trauma,' he said.
The Greens' justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said there could be more deaths at Parklea without urgent reforms.
'Correction facilities … are places where human beings are sent to be punished with little hope of recovery or redemption. That does not serve anyone,' she said on Wednesday.
Higginson has called for the removal of ligature points from all prison cells as 'an effective way to curtail preventable deaths'.
In 2022, the former Coalition government allocated $6m to refurbish cells in NSW public and private prisons including to remove ligature points, with a focus on cells holding prisoners deemed at high-risk of self-harm or suicide.
A spokesperson for CSNSW declined to say whether the man who died on Saturday had been identified as high-risk before his death.
The spokesperson said Parklea was 'the first point of entry into custody for many inmates' who were 'often withdrawing from drugs, experiencing heightened feelings of shame and guilt and presenting with previously undiagnosed physical and mental health issues'.
MTC Australia is the local arm of a private contractor that manages prisons in the US. Its Parklea contract is due to expire in 2026.
MTC took over operating Parklea in 2019. Since then, there have been 14 coronial inquests into deaths at the facility. Two have been finalised and it was found the deaths were due to 'unnatural' causes.
A parliamentary inquiry in 2018 found the problems at the prison had 'escalated to the point of crisis' under the management of its former operator GEO Group and the governance of corrective services.
Guardian Australia understands the government's preference is to return every prison to public ownership and that it will explore the cost of not renewing the contract for Parklea. MTC declined to comment.
Chanthivong said the government had begun the 'hugely complex undertaking' of reversing the privatisation of Junee and the 'the work we're doing now will inform
 
any future decisions' about other private jails.
Thirty-one of the state's 34 prisons are currently managed by the government. Clarence correctional centre near Grafton has been operated by Serco since it opened in 2020.

CBO: Federal Interest Payments Now Exceed Defense Spending,Avik Roy,2024-02-08 00:42:04,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2024/02/07/cbo-federal-interest-payments-now-exceed-defense-spending/,forbes.com,"According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2024 the U.S. will pass a grim and once-unimaginable milestone. By 2034, the federal debt will exceed $50 trillion.","Today, the Congressional Budget Office published its annual 10-year Budget and Economic Outlook. According to the CBO's latest estimates, in 2024 the U.S. government will pass a grim and once-unimaginable milestone. The federal debt has gotten so large that spending on interest to service that debt will exceed federal spending on national defense.

A startling projection

What's startling about the CBO's latest projections is that just one year ago, the Congressional budget scorekeepers estimated that interest payments would exceed defense spending in late 2028. By 2029, the CBO then projected, we'd be spending $1,041 billion on defense and $1,071 billion on interest.

Now that threshold will be crossed this year. In 2024, CBO estimates the federal government will spend $850 billion on defense, compared to $870 billion on interest. Under the CBO's new estimates, 2029 defense spending will be significantly less than previously projected ($954 billion) while interest payments will be higher than previously projected ($1,170 billion).

Part of the change is that CBO is belatedly acknowledging that interest rates are going to remain higher, for longer, than they had previously projected. That increases the cost of servicing the federal debt.

But the lower spending on defense is the result of Congressional action: the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which caps funding on discretionary (i.e., non-entitlement) spending in both defense and non-defense programs for 2024 and 2025.

The federal debt will reach $54 trillion in 2034

The lone piece of good news in the CBO report is that these spending caps, if they hold, will in fact reduce the deficit over time, from $2.9 trillion in 2033 under last year's estimates to $2.6 trillion with the latest estimates.

But $2.6 trillion is still a catastrophically high number. The problem is going to only get worse over time. Under the CBO's still-rosy predictions of future interest rates, in 2034 the federal debt will rise to $54 trillion (from $34 trillion today).

In the CBO's long-term projections, interest payments will become the largest line item in the budget—exceeding even spending on federal health care programs—sometime in the 2040s. It's very likely that sometime between now and then, global financial markets sour on U.S. Treasury bonds as a sound investment, leading to an unprecedented and dangerous economic crisis with rising interest rates, higher inflation, and social turmoil.

Between the COVID relief spending blowout and the 2021 infrastructure bill, Congress has increased the federal debt by over $6 trillion in the last four years. Just this month, the House passed a bipartisan tax bill that would increase the deficit by $118 billion in 2024 alone. The CBO's projections will get even worse if high interest rates persist, or if Congress passes further deficit-expanding legislation, as it is frequently wont to do.

Our holiday from fiscal history is ending

Of the three competitive major-party presidential candidates remaining, only former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has been consistently talking about the importance of tackling the federal debt. If Biden and Trump are once again the nominees, we're unlikely to get any commitments to fiscal discipline.

But that doesn't mean our holiday from fiscal history will continue. There simply is not enough money lying around in the rest of the world to lend to the United States. We will, at some point, have to tackle the high cost of federal health care spending, and the pending insolvency of Social Security.

"Almost half of multi-academy trusts in England in deficit, accountants find",Morgan Ofori,2024-02-06 18:58:38,full,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/06/almost-half-of-multi-academy-trusts-in-england-in-deficit-accountants-find,theguardian.com,"Trusts say costs, such as teacher pay and energy bills, increasing faster than funding","Pressure on school budgets from rising energy bills and staff costs drove almost half of multi-academy trusts into deficit last year, according to a financial health check on more than 2,300 schools in 
England
.
The benchmark report by the accountancy network Kreston UK, based on studying the accounts of 279 trusts representing more than 2,300 schools, found that 47% were running in-year deficits – spending more than their allocated revenue for the financial year ending in 2023.
'Trusts don't know what additional income streams they will receive from one year to the next,' said a Kreston auditor, Kevin Connor. 'Will they receive more money to cover energy costs? How much will be offered to cover pay review and pension contributions?'
The accountants found that many more schools would have been in deficit but for ad hoc grants averaging £60k for primaries and £200k for secondaries, as well as £447m in 'energy efficiency' grants awarded by the 
Department for Education
 last year.
Connor added that trusts had been 'extremely effective' at controlling costs but that did not alleviate a sense of uncertainty in the sector.
Benedicte Yue, chief financial officer of the River Learning Trust, said: 'Most trusts in the sector have done everything that the government has suggested to control costs – reviewing class sizes and curriculum to optimise staffing ratios, procurement and other areas that allow us to improve efficiencies. But the simple fact is that costs are increasing faster than funding and schools are constantly asked to do more with less.'
The news comes after the Department for Education 
admitted in October
 to bungling its funding figures for state schools in England, revealing a £370m error in previous announcements by ministers. The mistake means that mainstream primary and secondary schools will be given at least £50 less for each pupil than originally forecast, forcing school leaders to redraw their budgets for 2024-25.
Trusts say there are several costs that continue to place pressure on their finances. Energy costs are still high, the teacher recruitment and retention crisis has led to the use of costly agency staff, and the cost of food has increased, which affects the price of school catering contracts.
Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said: 'CST wants to see a fair per-pupil settlement that is sufficient, sustainable and equitable and includes weighting for disadvantage. We need a longer notice period for funding decisions to enable good strategic planning. Teachers deserve to be paid, but the last announcement of the teacher pay award came after all budgets had been set for trusts and schools.
'The quantum of funding for capital projects is not enough. We need a proper strategy for our schools, so they are safe places to learn for young people. It is essential that the next government addresses this.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Morgan Ofori,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/681dfa3b17c9c913ee0e3c919781fa3616c07b1d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4ce072506744761f441d2bbf0d0a8c2,False,@guardian,6.993189,ce6505648a55d8a14fa2860e3952eb22,"['school budgets', 'energy bills', 'staff costs', 'deficit', 'funding']",Almost half of multi-academy trusts in England were in deficit last year due to pressure on school budgets from rising energy bills and staff costs.

The council said they would put forward an amended policy at a future stage
Disability campaigners say ""there's more work to do"" after successfully fighting a proposed care policy.
 has withdrawn its 
Fair & Affordable Care Policy
 to put disabled people into homes if their residential care was too expensive. 
But some Bristol Reclaiming Independent Living (BRIL) campaigners are concerned the policy will reappear 
 once again without consultation
.
""The key word is withdrawn. It hasn't been cancelled,"" said Val Stanfield.
The proposed policy by the council tried to reduce the cost of disability care as a result of ""chronic underfunding"" from the government for the Adult Social Care sector.
Cost saving proposals included installing ceiling hoists in homes rather than funding a care worker or personal assistant (PA).
Disabled campaigners appealed to barristers that moving forward with the policy would infringe on their human rights. 
The group advocates for independent living, allowing people to choose whether to stay in their own home and have their care needs met there. 
Campaigner Mark Williams said: ""People will lose their independence, it will affect their mental health, and it would put the disability movement back by 40 years.
""We are not the problem,"" he added.

Mr Williams said not enough people were made aware of the initial policy consultation
Adult social care chief, Councillor Helen Holland, assured campaigners the council will instead work on a ""future policy"" which fits within the agreed budget, whilst meeting the diverse needs of the population.
""In June 2023,  Cabinet took a decision to consult on the Fair and Affordable Care policy and to bring a final version back to cabinet for a decision,"" she said. 
""In discussion with the Mayor, we have now agreed that the policy will not be taken forward at this time, and that officers will work on the basis that a future policy will come forward to a future administration for a decision. 
""The work that individuals and organisations have put into responding to us in recent months will not be wasted, as we will share the consultation responses and the independent legal advice that was jointly requested to inform the ongoing work,"" she added.
However, some people believe the controversial policy might once again rear its head.
""It's not over, there's more work to do,"" said Mr Williams.
""We are very happy on one point but we don't want it to come in through the back door.""
In response to the concerns,  said a new budget allocation framework will be developed by October this year.
""Like all councils, we continue to face a cost of operating crisis after social care costs and demand have risen significantly over recent years. 
""Despite this challenge, and continuing national austerity, we have delivered and will continue to deliver our duties in line with the Care Act.""

Hundreds of thousands of UK cancer patients forced to pay for private treatment,Andrew Gregory,2024-02-07 06:00:08,full,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/07/hundreds-of-thousands-of-uk-cancer-patients-forced-to-pay-for-private-treatment,theguardian.com,"Exclusive: As NHS targets are being missed nearly 300,000 people paid for chemotherapy in last five years","Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients in the UK are being forced to pay for private treatment amid record 
NHS
 waiting times, according to data obtained by the Guardian.
The figures emerged as 
King Charles began treatment
 for the disease within days of being diagnosed. Buckingham Palace has not specified whether the king is receiving private healthcare or being treated on the National Health Service.
While the king is already receiving expert care, his treatment will draw fresh attention to the long cancer waiting times in the state-run NHS, which is widely regarded by experts as being in crisis.
The proportion of patients in 
England
 waiting less than 62 days from an urgent suspected cancer referral or consultant upgrade to their first definitive treatment for cancer is 65.2%, according to the most recent figures. The target is 85%.
The figures, for November, show that one in 10 people are being denied treatment within 31 days of their cancer being found and a decision being made to treat them. Some 90.1% are seen within this timeframe in England, lower than the 96% NHS target.
Amid growing frustration at NHS waiting lists, record numbers of people are paying for private healthcare. Nearly 300,000 people in the UK have paid for chemotherapy in the last five years, figures provided to the Guardian show.
Between 2018 and 2023, 282,560 people funded chemotherapy treatments through insurance, according to the Private Healthcare Information Network, an independent, government-backed information service about private consultants and hospitals. A further 13,900 paid for their own chemotherapy, the data shows.
Thousands dying needlessly from cancer in UK, report says
The PHIN said it could not provide figures for people paying to undergo cancer surgery, radiotherapy or other forms of private cancer treatment. It means the total number of people paying for private cancer treatment is likely to be even higher.
On Monday, the king spent the night at his Clarence House home near Buckingham Palace after beginning a series of outpatient treatments within days of his diagnosis.
The cancer was discovered when Charles stayed three nights last month in the London Clinic, an exclusive private hospital in Marylebone, where he underwent a corrective procedure for a benign enlarged prostate.
Buckingham Palace has not specified which healthcare provider is treating the king. But it is understood that in selecting providers, a balance of factors was taken into account. They included his privacy and security, the most appropriate specialists for the condition, and the potential impact on other patients and on the resources of the NHS and other healthcare providers.

Amid record waiting times for cancer treatment on the NHS, survival rates for cancer in the UK lag behind those of other European countries for nine out of 10 of the most common types of the disease, according to an NHS Confederation report published in January.
A separate report commissioned by 
Cancer
 Research UK last week said progress in UK cancer survival was now slower than it has been for 50 years. The study said the UK lagged behind comparable countries, such as Australia, Canada, Denmark and Norway, in tackling the disease.
Researchers said cancer waiting times across the country were among the worst on record, too many cancers were diagnosed at a late stage, and access to treatment was unequal.
The NHS in England said on Tuesday that it was seeing and treating record numbers of people for cancer, with 30% more people treated last year than in 2015-16 and almost 3 million people receiving potentially life-saving cancer checks in the last 12 months.
'It is vital that people come forward if they are concerned about cancer symptoms – getting checked early saves lives,' a spokesperson added.

"NHS dentistry ‘recovery plan' not worthy of the title, dentists say",Aletha Adu,2024-02-07 00:01:04,full,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/07/nhs-dentistry-recovery-plan-not-worthy-of-the-title-dentists-say,theguardian.com,British Dental Association says government's plan does not offer hope to millions struggling to access care,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of making a U-turn on his pledge to restore 
NHS
 dentistry as experts say his new 'recovery plan' does not offer enough money to incentivise dentists to take on extra NHS patients.
The prime minister's long-awaited proposals have been criticised for failing to ringfence funding for the dental sector and reform the NHS dentistry contract, which means millions across the country will continue to struggle to access care.
Sunak's plan, described as the means to 'put NHS dentistry on a sustainable footing', comes after 
police were called to manage a queue
 of hundreds of people outside a reopened dental practice in Bristol on Monday.
Under the plan, NHS dentists will be given a 'new patient' payment of between £15 and £50, depending on the treatment needed, to help care for a million new patients who have not seen a dentist in two years or more.
The British Dental Association (BDA) has said the £200m pledged by the government is less than half of the underspends in the budget expected this year, leaving no new money for the promised new patient premium.
The government accidentally sent details of the scheme to all MPs on Tuesday afternoon, which included the plan to offer NHS dentists cash incentives to take on extra patients and a new scheme to send dental teams to schools to tackle tooth decay, which appears to have been scrapped.
Sunak was praised for offering parents and parents-to-be advice on how to take care of babies' gums and milk teeth as part of a 'Smile for Life' programme. Dental vans will be deployed in rural and coastal areas to reach the most isolated communities.
But Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA's general dental practice committee, said: 'This ‘recovery plan' is not worthy of the title. It won't halt the exodus from the workforce or offer hope to millions struggling to access care. Nothing here meets government's stated ambitions, or makes this service fit for the future.
'Ministers wanted to stop dentistry becoming an election issue. By rearranging the deckchairs they've achieved the exact opposite. The crisis will remain a burning issue in communities across this country until we get real change.'
Labour accused the government of stealing its dentist recruitment plans and 
proposals on supervised toothbrushing
 that were rubbished by a number of Conservative MPs earlier this year.
The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: 'After 14 years of Conservative neglect, patients are desperately queuing around the block to see a dentist, literally pulling their own teeth out, and tooth decay is the No 1 reason for six- to 10-year-olds being admitted to hospital.
'The Conservatives are only promising to do something about it now there's an election coming. By adopting Labour's proposals for recruitment and supervised toothbrushing, they are finally admitting that they are out of ideas of their own. It will be left to the next Labour government to rescue NHS dentistry and get patients seen on time once again.'
According to the BDA, 23,577 dentists carried out NHS work in the 2022-23 financial year, the lowest number since 2012-13 and a reduction of 1,100 dentists compared with pre-pandemic levels.
Four in five dentists across England are not taking on new NHS patients, and according to analysis by the Labour party 71.1% are not accepting children.

Can consumers rescue China's economy?,The Economist,2024-02-06 19:47:30,full,https://www.economist.com/china/2024/02/06/can-consumers-rescue-chinas-economy,economist.com,Our number-crunching suggests economic 'rebalancing' will be exceptionally hard,"M
OST EMERGING
 economies struggle to live within their means; China struggles to live up to them. Even in the best of times, the combined spending of its households, firms and government is not enough to buy all that it can produce, leaving a surplus that must be exported: the country has run a trade surplus for 34 of the past 40 years. And these are not the best of times. China is enduring its longest spell of deflation since the Asian crisis over a quarter-century ago. An epic stockmarket rout since late 2022 has seen investors lose $2trn.
Behind that panic lies a deeper fear among investors and officials, namely that China no longer has a reliable driver of growth. The property boom is over. Cash-strapped developers are afraid to build flats and households are afraid to buy them. The infrastructure mania has run out of road: indebted local governments lack the funds. Exporting goods to the rest of the world, which China relied on for decades to escape poverty, is getting harder as protectionism rises and Western countries become wary of relying on authoritarian states.
Much therefore rests on one remaining source of growth: boosting the spending of China's 1.4bn people. 'The Chinese market, with its vast space and growing depth, will play an important role in boosting aggregate global demand,' Li Qiang, China's prime minister, told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. A new 
IMF
 review of China's prospects published on February 2nd contains 61 references to the word 'consumption'.
The goal of raising consumption makes sense. China's stingy consumers often prefer to save, not spend. Consumption accounts for 53% of 
GDP
, compared with 72% for the world. On this measure China ranks 156th out of 168 countries. Its resulting lopsided contribution to the world economy is stark. It accounts for 32% of global investment and 18% of 
GDP
, but only 13% of consumption, according to Michael Pettis, an economist. Even among emerging economies, China stands out: it consumed 7% less per person than Brazil in 2022, even though it produced about 40% more.
What are the prospects of rising consumption bailing China out? The good news is that 2023 showed some recovery as the end of pandemic-era restrictions allowed people to return to restaurants, shops and travel. As a result, consumption accounted for over 80% of growth, the biggest share since 1999. The bad news is that the prospects of a step change appear slight, based on the public mood, cross-country maths and China's own history.
Start with the public mood. The turmoil in the property market has damaged the income, assets and morale of ordinary Chinese. Take Mr Chen, a construction worker from Jiangsu province. He has struggled at times to find work—and is not always paid when he does. He ploughed his savings into a flat for his children in a town near his village, where many properties cannot find buyers. 'What's frightening is not the past, but the future.' The mood is mirrored in forecasts: the 
IMF
 expects consumption growth to slow during 2024.
image: The Economist
Then consider the cross-country maths. Even if China escapes deflation this year, the long-term pivot required is daunting. For China to successfully rebalance its economy, consumption would need to rise by about ten percentage points of 
GDP
, according to calculations by Mr Pettis. 
The Economist
 has examined how often this sort of shift has occurred around the world, looking at the experience of 181 countries since 1960 and dividing their economic history into rolling ten-year intervals. We found that only in 11% of cases did consumption rise by more than ten percentage points in the space of a decade (see chart). Some of these cases are not encouraging. Albania had a consumption mania in the early 1990s but also experienced hyperinflation. Taiwan managed a ten-point shift from 1986 to 1996, but the consumer boom was associated with a wild stockmarket bubble.
Finally, consider China's own history. Its policymakers have talked about rebalancing the economy towards consumption, and away from exports and investment, for almost 20 years, since a key economic conference at the end of 2004. Back then, total consumption's share of 
GDP
 was about 55%—about the same as today. Rebalancing, it seems, is easier said than done.
The right kind of consumption
Despite this, China has little choice but to try. One option is to promote a new consumer culture. Mr Li, in his Davos speech, spoke of the widening purchase of big-ticket items, such as electric vehicles, as well as niche products including 'smart' homes, tickets to sporting events and 'China-chic goods'. But social change cuts both ways. Even as they say they want to promote spending, officials are on guard against the wrong kind. Draft regulations on video games, issued in December then withdrawn, instructed companies to punctuate their games with pop-up warnings against 'irrational consumption behaviour'. China's leaders could, alternatively, stimulate consumption through short-term handouts to households. But they seem to view such handouts as ineffective, wasteful or worse: an invitation to laziness.
That means the most plausible lever is to make citizens feel more financially secure, so that they save less and splurge more. Expanding health care and pension provision further is key in the long run. And citizens like Mr Chen might feel relaxed about spending more if it were easier for them to settle in the cities in which they work. Under China's 
hukou
 system, a household registry, Mr Chen is officially a resident of his home village. That makes it harder for him to access schools, hospitals or pensions in the cities where he earns a living.
Cai Fang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences thinks giving migrant workers urban 
hukou
 could raise their consumption by as much as 30%, although other studies report less dramatic results. A study by economists at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu found that rural migrants who obtain urban 
hukou
 spend about as much as native city-dwellers, but do so more conspicuously. The end of the housing bubble could also liberate consumers. The cost of saving for a down-payment and servicing a mortgage was 11% of city-dwellers' disposable income in 2021, according to rough estimates by Goldman Sachs. That figure could fall to about 6% in a decade, it estimates.
Yet for now China's approach to 
hukou 
reform is timid and piecemeal, any dividend from the housing pivot is years away, and there is little sign of comprehensive welfare-state reform. Consumption will probably increase somewhat as a share of 
GDP
, as a large cohort of retiring workers keeps spending but stops producing. The associated demographic drag, however, is hardly positive for growth. For economically insecure citizens like Mr Chen, the equation points only one way. At 51 he is only nine years from the customary retirement age for blue-collar workers. But he must look after his parents as well as his youngest child. 'It all depends on me. I don't dare do the maths.' For China's government the calculations are similarly daunting.

A Bird's Eye View Of Large Language Model Security,Sandeep Kamble,2024-02-07 12:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/07/a-birds-eye-view-of-large-language-model-security/,forbes.com,"LLMs offer unprecedented linguistic capabilities, yet they introduce intricate security challenges requiring unwavering attention.","A Cybersecurity Leader & SecureLayer7 Founder. Founded BugDazz & AuthSafe. Former Bug-Bounty Hunter.

At the core of large language model (LLM) security lies a paradox: the very technology empowering these models to craft narratives can be exploited for malicious purposes.

LLMs pose a fundamental security challenge in generating content that can deceive or manipulate, blurring the lines between authentic and manipulated content. This exploration reveals strategies to mitigate risks and ensure the responsible use of this cutting-edge technology.

Security Threats Of LLMs

LLMs usher in a new era of linguistic AI, but not without significant security threats. This section dissects the specific risks associated with LLMs, focusing on their technical underpinnings.

Data Leakage And Privacy Concerns

LLMs demand substantial data for training, often involving sensitive or private information. Preventing data leakage and ensuring confidentiality throughout the training process is critical due to the far-reaching consequences of data privacy breaches.

Generation Of Malicious Content

A palpable security threat is LLMs' capacity to generate malicious content, from deepfake text to deceptive messages. Preventing misuse is pivotal for maintaining trust and security in the digital realm.

Biases In Model Outputs

LLMs, like other AI models, are susceptible to biases in their outputs, resulting in content reflecting stereotypes or partiality. Addressing these biases is both a technical challenge and an ethical imperative to ensure fair and impartial content.

Model Poisoning And Adversarial Attacks

LLMs can be vulnerable to deliberate manipulation, including crafting input data to produce unintended or undesirable outputs. Model poisoning attacks aim to skew the model's behavior, compromising the integrity of LLM-generated content and introducing security vulnerabilities.

Mitigating LLM Security Risks

Addressing the security risks posed by LLMs requires a structured approach and diligent practices. Best practices include:

1. Secure Model Training and Data Management. Securing both the model and the data used for training is imperative. This involves safeguarding the model architecture, training pipeline and data repositories, as well as implementing encryption and access controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

2. Regular Audits and Testing for Bias and Vulnerabilities. Ensuring LLM outputs remain unbiased and secure requires regular audits and testing. Tools and methodologies are available to evaluate the model's behavior, detect biased outputs and rectify issues, aligning LLMs with ethical standards.

3. Implementing Strong Access Controls. Access controls form a pivotal layer of LLM security. Implementing role-based access controls, authentication mechanisms and authorization policies limits the risk of unauthorized usage, extending to API access to prevent misuse.

4. Continuous Monitoring and Response Plans. LLM security is an ongoing process. Continuous monitoring is crucial to detect anomalies and potential security breaches, allowing security teams to respond promptly to emerging threats and take corrective action.

Ethical Considerations

Large language models also come with ethical considerations that are intertwined with using these powerful AI tools in cybersecurity. Key ethical implications include:

1. Privacy and Data Handling. LLMs often require vast amounts of data, raising an ethical dilemma regarding leveraging this data while preserving user privacy. Ethical frameworks dictate anonymizing personal data and seeking individuals' consent for using their data in LLMs for cybersecurity purposes.

2. Bias and Fairness. Addressing biases inherited from training data is an ethical imperative. AI practitioners must actively work to identify and rectify biases to ensure fair and equitable outcomes in cybersecurity applications.

3. Transparency and Accountability. The ""black box"" nature of LLMs can lead to concerns regarding accountability. Providing transparency by explaining the rationale behind LLM-generated decisions and establishing accountability mechanisms is crucial and must align with ethical considerations, ensuring they do not encroach upon individual privacy rights.

4. Privacy-Preserving Techniques. Technical strategies like federated learning, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption enable LLMs to provide valuable insights while protecting sensitive data, ensuring responsible and privacy-preserving usage.

5. Informed Consent. Obtaining informed consent when using LLMs in cybersecurity is an ethical necessity. Users must be aware of how their data is used and have the right to opt out or request the deletion of their data.

6. Regulatory Compliance. Adherence to data protection regulations is both a technical necessity and an ethical obligation, ensuring LLMs are employed in a manner that respects individual rights and data privacy.

The Future Of LLM Security

The future of LLM security is intrinsically linked to the dynamic evolution of both LLMs and the field of cybersecurity. Key trends and technologies shaping this evolving landscape include some of the following.

Evolving LLM Capabilities

Advancements in LLMs include larger and more sophisticated models with refined language understanding, reasoning and generation capabilities. Enhanced comprehension of context, nuances and domain-specific knowledge enables LLMs to excel in a wider range of applications, including cybersecurity.

Improved Data Privacy And Security

Future LLMs demand more stringent data privacy and security measures. Technologies like secure multi-party computation and federated learning allow processing of data without exposing sensitive information, aligning data utilization with ethical and regulatory standards.

Adversarial Defense Mechanisms

As adversarial attacks become more sophisticated, LLM security relies on advanced defense mechanisms. Future LLMs may incorporate real-time adversarial detection and adaptation, recognizing and responding to malicious inputs. Continuous training on diverse datasets can help bolster resilience against adversarial threats.

Quantum-Resistant Encryption

The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to existing encryption methods. Future LLMs and cybersecurity will likely necessitate quantum-resistant encryption techniques to secure sensitive data and communications, becoming a cornerstone of LLM security in the quantum computing era.

AI Ethics And Governance

Ethical and governance frameworks surrounding LLMs will evolve, emphasizing increased transparency, accountability and standardized ethical guidelines.

Components such as AI model audits, ethics boards, and regulatory compliance will most likely become integral for responsible LLM usage.



LLMs offer unprecedented linguistic capabilities, yet they introduce intricate security challenges requiring unwavering attention. The very complexity that makes LLMs powerful also renders them susceptible to nuanced vulnerabilities, especially in the realm of data privacy and model manipulation. For example: prompt injections and lack of access control for the multi-tenant environment.

What if you could see your publicly exposed infrastructure through their eyes, anticipate their moves, and shore up your defenses before they even struck?

That's the power of understanding hacker recon. As the CEO of a cloud security company, I've learned that when it comes to implementing cybersecurity strategies, it's not enough to merely react to threats. To stay ahead of the curve, we need to think like attackers, not just defenders. That said, here I discuss how to adopt the hacker's perspective and use it to strengthen your cloud security posture.

Understanding What Hacker Recon Is

Think of hacker reconnaissance (recon) as detective work done before a cyberattack is launched. It's when hackers gather information about their target, such as a company's computer systems and networks. Through this, they're trying to understand the layout of the digital front, looking for any security gaps, attack vectors or potential entry points that they can exploit later.

Simply put, the more information they uncover, the more smoothly their ""operation"" can go—just like any good detective needs solid clues to crack a case. So, next time you hear about a cyberattack, remember that it often starts with this information-gathering phase.

There are two main ways hackers do their recon:

• Passive recon involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. Hackers might use search engines, social media, public records and other online sources to find information about the target, such as IP addresses, domain names, employee email addresses and software versions.

• Active recon is directly interacting with the target system to gather information. Hackers might use tools like ping sweeps, port scans and vulnerability scanners to identify open ports, running services and potential security weaknesses.

Of the two reconnaissance methods, active recon strategies are mostly used by companies to take a proactive stance. This way, they can gain valuable insights into their own security posture, identify potential weaknesses and address them before attackers exploit them.

Why Getting A Hacker's Perspective Matters

With almost every application nowadays being cloud-native, the cloud's vast space creates a sprawling, dynamic attack surface. Hence, understanding this unique cloud front from hacker perspectives is crucial for building resilient cloud defenses.

Here's how it can help your strategy.

Anticipating Hacker Moves

Imagine a master chess player. They don't just react to moves; they predict them, forcing their opponents into traps. Similarly, by adopting a hacker mindset, you see the vulnerabilities or loopholes in your cloud front they're looking to exploit.

Identifying Exploitable Gaps Before Hackers Do

Traditional defense often focuses on patching immediate vulnerabilities after an attack. This reactive approach can leave you vulnerable to the next novel exploit, the next unforeseen vulnerability. By getting a hacker's POV and conducting regular reconnaissance on your systems, you can promptly spot exploitable gaps before they become attack vectors.

Prioritizing Resources And Focusing On The Most Critical Vulnerabilities

Resources are limited, so focusing on every vulnerability dilutes your defenses. When it comes to a battlefield, for instance, would you send all your troops to defend every inch of land? Of course not! You identify the critical points and high-value assets and focus your defenses there.

Having the hacker perspective helps you do the same in the cloud. You understand which vulnerabilities pose the biggest risk—the ones that could bring your whole operation crashing down.

How To Adopt A Hacker's Perspective

Adopting a hacker's perspective isn't just about a change in thinking—it's about implementing real-world practices and strategies. But how do you put this into practice? Let's explore some actionable steps:

Collaborating With Ethical Hackers

Ethical hackers bring a different perspective to the table, identifying vulnerabilities that your internal security team might miss. Their ability to think like hackers makes them adept at spotting vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

Leveraging Threat Intelligence

Stay proactive in securing against cybersecurity threats by signing up for threat intelligence feeds. These feeds offer the most up-to-date details on hacking methods, vulnerabilities and threat actors. Make the most of this valuable information to spot risks in advance and tweak your security measures accordingly.

Investing In Modern Security Tools

Leverage modern cloud security tools that secure your cloud and application infrastructure end-to-end. These should actively scan for vulnerabilities, identify attack vectors, map public-facing assets and expose open ports, thereby giving you the hacker's POV of your infrastructure.

Also, make sure to:

• Start small. Don't try to overhaul your entire organization overnight. Begin with pilot projects or specific departments.

• Focus on value. Ensure your hacking efforts are aligned with business goals and deliver tangible benefits.

• Measure and iterate. Track the impact of your hacking initiatives and adapt your approach based on results.

Bottom Line

Stepping into the shoes of a hacker reveals blind spots in your defenses you might not have considered. Taking this proactive approach along with the hacker's POV empowers you to build a layered, resilient security posture.

Cybersecurity isn't about building impassable walls but anticipating and fixing potential entry points and attack vectors. By understanding what attackers perceive, you can stay ahead of the curve and make your organization a less tempting target. Don't wait for a breach to be your wake-up call. Use these steps to start thinking like a hacker today and build a defense that's one step ahead.

Don't Be Afraid To Be Paranoid About AI,Eric Hutto,2024-02-07 12:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2024/02/07/dont-be-afraid-to-be-paranoid-about-ai/,forbes.com,Do explore AI and adopt it where it makes the most sense for your business. But be paranoid.,"Eric Hutto is Chief Executive Officer at Diversified.

Technology can help accelerate human potential and make things better. Unfortunately, as we all found out in a post-pandemic world, technology also can make things a whole lot worse.

Just look at all the problems social media and misinformation are creating, and consider what's happening with The New York Times suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.

That's why companies have social media policies, and it's why businesses now need AI policies.

We have created an AI policy outlining the acceptable and responsible use of AI at Diversified. It establishes guidelines and best practices to ensure AI systems are used ethically, transparently and in a manner consistent with our values, legal requirements and industry standards.

This applies to our associates, contractors, subcontractors, third-party vendors and others using or interacting with AI in the performance of their responsibilities on behalf of our company.

I believe that getting educated about, being cautious with and picking the right spots for AI technology can empower businesses to become more productive, efficient organizations with superior solutions—and be more likely to avoid being sued for copyright infringement, destroying shareholder value, suffering reputational damage or getting taken down by other risks presented by AI.

Here is our approach to AI and things to consider as your company creates its own AI policy.

AI doesn't know how to look for intellectual property infringement. It doesn't care. It just grabs content. But there is an appropriate use of content we need to respect. Not all content is free.

If AI is pointed externally, you need to address copyright and patent infringement. You'll want a governance process before you publish. Our AI policy strictly prohibits the unauthorized use of copyrighted or patented material or the creation of content that infringes on the intellectual property (IP) of others.

If AI is 100% focused internally on your datasets, however, you may not need to do an IP review.

It's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It depends on how AI is applied in each organization.

Use AI To Improve Processes And Productivity

My company mostly uses AI internally right now. For example, ChatGPT wrote our VP of marketing job description in 32 seconds, and it did a darn good job.

Did my HR people scrutinize it? Yes. Did my legal team review it? Absolutely. But do I really need people now to write job descriptions? Probably not. Writing job descriptions is one low-risk area for which AI can get it done better, quicker and faster. There's also a tremendous opportunity to use AI to accelerate financial, process and safety audits.

Additionally, you can leverage AI in your tech stacks to make your solutions and business models more intelligent. That's what our innovation group is doing—but with an AI policy on top, so we do it in a very controlled way that doesn't introduce more risk to our company than we need to.

Don't Point AI Toward People

AI exposes us to bias. How do we guard against that and avoid adding more bias to the world? The answer for my company is not aiming AI at people. That way, we have a lot less risk of bias because we're not using AI to assess and affect people.

AI models learn and evolve very quickly. We don't know enough yet about how fast AI is going to change and what it is really going to do. We've still got a lot more to learn about AI. And as businesses learn more about AI over time, we'll all have a better chance of managing bias.

Have Your Legal Team Write Your AI Policy

Don't let anybody other than your legal team write your AI policy. It's probably safest to start with the ethical conversation and what could go wrong, then work your way back to other constituents.

Never rely on innovation leaders to create your AI policy. They'll be looking at AI from the standpoint of innovation, and they're going to want to have their freedoms.

Back when we used open-source code, technologists wanted access to everything. The very first thing our innovation leader said was: 'I don't want to restrict it from doing this.' Yeah, we do.

Avoid getting enamored with shiny objects. That's typically what gets people into trouble.

Ensure Top Leadership Is Involved

CEOs should also be deeply involved because there are big ramifications if you get this wrong. The CEO shouldn't necessarily drive the AI policy. But CEOs need to make sure the policy gets done, understand it holistically and sign off on it on behalf of the company's investors and board.

This is even more important in light of The New York Times lawsuit, which has been all over Squawk Box. Discussions about AI risk are heading straight up to the board level. AI policy is going to hit board agendas just like cybersecurity did when ransomware became a problem.

So, no CEO should yield the responsibility of their company's AI policy to someone else.

Frequently Review Your AI Policy

Lots of new AI developments will come down the road over the next year. Lawsuits will be settled. Courts will set precedents. Agencies will work to meet deadlines and produce deliverables related to the AI Executive Order the White House issued in October.

Keep a close eye on these things and other new developments in the marketplace related to lawsuits and discussions about AI usage. Revisit your AI policy every six months. This is going to be important because the AI landscape is developing so fast.

Understand And Control Your Risk

Approaching AI cautiously, picking the right spots for this powerful technology and staying informed about precedents you may be judged against can provide you with one of the best chances of safety.

Do explore AI and adopt it where it makes the most sense for your business. But be paranoid.

"Where World Of Warcraft Led, Banks Will Follow",David G.W. Birch,2024-02-07 16:01:20,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2024/02/07/where-world-of-warcraft-led-banks-will-follow/,forbes.com,I can remember watching a YouTube video of a guy playing World of Warcraft. He gradually realised that he was the only human. Welcome to the future of financial services.,"I can remember, some years ago, watching a YouTube video that a guy had recorded while he was playing World of Warcraft, the massively multi-player online role playing (MMORG). As the game progressed, he gradually began to realise that he was the only human player and that all of the other avatars in the game were actually controlled by bots. Welcome to the future of financial services.

Bots And Money

The mounting incredulity in that player's voice as he came to the conclusion—observing the behaviour of the various robo-orcs, bit-goblins, digital dragons and whatnot,—that he was the last person left in the game was fascinating to me. I showed this video at a few seminars and workshops and told people that I found it a more interesting vision of the future of banking than people queueing in a virtual branch in Second Life. The impact bots on that World of Warcraft economy is worth noting. For one thing, it was complicated. Some goods in the game became less valuable because bots were working round the clock to obtain them whereas others became more valuable because "" bot mafias ' cornered the market.

That poor chap playing alone came to mind when I read the widely reported case of a worker who was tricked into transferring some $25 million after fraudsters using deepfake technology posed as his company's CFO CFO in a video conference call with what the mark thought were several other members of staff. In fact he was the only human being and everyone else in the video call was a deepfake recreation.

(I'd like to think that if I was in a Zoom meeting with some board colleagues at one of the companies that I advise and the CEO asked me to transfer some money to an unknown third-party, then I might be sufficiently suspicious to Signal the CEO out-of-band and double check the instructions. But I suppose a great many people exist in more hierarchical and structured organisations where this reaction might be seen as expressing disloyalty or disagreement.)

Given the increasing quality of deepfakes, the ease of use of sophisticated voice cloning technology, and the tendency of too many people to turn off their cameras during Zoom meeting anyway, it is no surprise to me to see that enterprising criminals are launching such attacks. Synthetic identity fraud is already one of the fastest-growing cybersecurity threats, accounting for nearly 80% of all identity fraud in the U.S. (and is estimated to cost businesses close to $5 billion this year). With generative AI helping them to scale up their attacks, it is hardly hyperbolic to talk about the tsunami of fraud that it going to wash away trust not only in commerce but in politics and the media as well. We've already seen fake videos and phone calls featuring Joe Biden, for example, and are close to the point where we can no longer believe almost anything we see online.

(A recent report that analyzed billions of sessions across various industries and regions found that almost three-quarters of all web and app traffic was malicious, driven by bots and human fraud farms that launched a variety attacks via SMS, the web and mobile phones.)

Since we lack a working population-scale digital identity infrastructure, and appear to lack the will to assemble one, I suppose we'll just have to get used to mass market mountebanks engaging in large-scale fraud, and just put up with it except in cases where there is a bank somewhere in the loop so that we can make it their problem and force bank shareholders to cough up under something like the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) in place in our United Kingdom. Mind you, the extent of fraud is now so great that going without a practical strategy to attack seems like suicidal approach to a cancer spreading throughout the financial system. Fraud is already more than 40% of all reported crime in England and Wales, yet according to the National Crime Agency it is "" largely underreported ' with only around a sixth of all incidents being reported to the relevant authorities!

Given the scale of fraud, the billions and billions flowing from the UK (and the USA) straight into criminals' pockets, it really shouldn't be that hard to find a business case for a solution. It is not just about money through, a recent report from Visa V looks at the the negative impact of authorised push payment (APP) fraud on UK consumers beyond the financial losses. Their research found that one in three of those surveyed reported that their mental health suffered as a result of the fraud and almost half feel at risk of falling for the scam again. Visa call for cross-industry collaboration to fight fraud, with an increased focus on prevention measures. That is, more effort directed towards stopping the money from leaving victims' bank accounts rather than trying to find the criminals afterwards.

Time For Action

I agree, of course, but it makes me ask the question as to what kind of cross-industry collaboration this should this be. Were we to actually want to do anything about the problem then we should probably start with having some kind of financial services passport, a bank-issued digital identity that would take the place of payer and payee addresses in transactions. In other words we could amend the instant payment infrastructure to allow access to institutions only and give retail consumer and business customers access only via a request-to-pay (R2P) layer or a variable recurring payment (VRP) layer, both of which would deal with digital identities, and not branch, codes, routing numbers and other such relics from the dawn of bank automation.

While consumers would see this switch from sending money to branch XXYYZZ and account 00998877 to responding to a request from £dgwbirch as a matter of convenience and simplicity, under the hood it would be a world of identification, authentication and authorisation using the tried and tested cryptographic techniques. Central to this solution would be restoring trust, so that consumers know that if they send money to £dgwbirch or £tesco or £mancity then the money can only go to the intended recipient. How much would it cost to create this infrastructure compared to the cost of fraud already here, let alone the fraud to come!",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,2,US,en,David G.W.

Wolves Of Wall Street Turn To IPOs,Brandon Kochkodin,2024-02-08 11:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2024/02/08/wolves-of-wall-street-turn-to-ipos/,forbes.com,"In the netherworld of risky penny stocks, reverse mergers are out and initial public offerings are back in style. Buyer beware.","In the netherworld of risky penny stocks, reverse mergers are out and initial public offerings are back in style. Buyer beware.

bout an hour by rapid train northwest of Shanghai, China in the city of Changzhou (pop: 5.2 million) are the offices of Jin Medical International, a maker of 'high-end' wheelchairs. Incorporated in the Cayman Islands in January 2020, Jin's wheelchairs are known for being ergonomic and lightweight and recently the company began making electric and ski-friendly models.

Last March, with the help of a little known New York-based underwriter named Prime Number Capital LLC, Jin Medical IPO'd on Nasdaq, raising $8 million at $8 per share. While the Nasdaq 100 index, which includes market stars like Nvidia, has risen 40% in the last 12 months or so, Jin's stock has climbed to $221, logging near 3,000% gains and a market capitalization of $1.73 billion. Though the company hasn't filed any financial statements with the SEC since August 2023, at the time its revenues were running at about $20 million annually, with profits of around $3.5 million, giving it a price-earnings ratio in excess of 500.

The most important news released by Jin Medical came in December 2023, when it announced a potential acquisition of Jiangsu Zhongjin Kanglu Information Technology, a medical equipment company adept at 'leveraging its manufacturing expertise and big data analytics technology' to rent or share wheelchairs among 1,600 hospitals in China. Few other details were given, except that serious negotiations would commence in March 2024.

Jin Medical's story is the type that brokers, schooled in the Jordan Belfort method of stock flogging, dream about. Add China's rapidly-aging billion-plus population, with the demand for ergonomic, lightweight wheelchairs and then sprinkle in big data and AI powered 'wheelchair-sharing,' and you get a stock that climbed from under $30 two months ago to a recent high of $276.

Fifteen years ago, Jin Medical would've probably picked a reverse merger for its market debut. That's when a private company merges with an already listed public 'shell' company, skirting the formal IPO process which typically involves lawyers and underwriters and considerable costs. Dormant shells of public companies are plentiful, so reverse mergers tend to be cheaper, and they don't need an underwriter's nod or brokers' buy-in. Sounds ideal, but reverse mergers, especially those involving Chinese companies, are now considered tainted merchandise by investors, so the peddlers of microcap stocks have avoided them. In 2013, McKinsey estimated that suspended and delisted reverse mergers involving Chinese companies cost investors as much as $40 billion in 2011 and 2012, alone.

In January, the SEC announced a tightening of its regulations for reverse mergers and SPACs, including more stringent disclosures of conflicts of interest, sponsor compensation and shareholder dilution. With the advantages accessing public markets via a reverse merger diminished, small companies like Jin Medical are increasingly choosing initial public offerings, egged on by a growing group of penny-stock underwriters, brokers and a legion of day traders looking to flip them for a quick profit. Between 2010 and 2023, the U.S. witnessed an average of 104 reverse mergers each year, according to FactSet data, including de-SPAC transactions. In 2023, the number fell to just 40, the lowest since 2012, which recorded 71.

Kyle Asman, managing partner of Backswing Ventures, an Orlando, Florida-based venture fund, thinks reverse mergers have suffered because small caps have been out of favor for some time. These days, even novice retail investors realize that simply investing in large cap dominated index funds, like the S&P 500, has proven to be an easy, winning strategy.

'It's the top 20 stocks that are driving all the stock market growth,' says Asman. 'These younger companies aren't getting the multiples that they were…if you do a reverse merger and the stock doesn't rip, it's a death knell.'

everse-mergers may no longer be the product du jour, but tiny initial public offerings are back with a vengeance. According to data collected by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, there were 47 penny-stock IPOs last year, and a total 120 from 2021 through 2023. From 2000 through 2020, there were just 108 such deals.

'The last two years, there's been an unusually large number of microcap and penny-stock IPOs,' says Ritter.

IPOs, unlike reverse mergers, come with little stigma attached. And compared to reverse mergers, they're sexy. Traditionally, if you wanted to buy an IPO, you needed to be both rich and connected. This is where diy investor-friendly brokerages like New York City's Webull come in. On Webull's web site it advertises an IPO calendar of stocks their clients have a chance of buying into. The list, which currently has 20 offering available over the next month or so, is brimming with penny stocks. Many of them are operating in Asia, including Mingteng International, a Chinese maker of automotive molds for electric vehicles which had $8 million in revenues in 2022, and Zerospo, which rings up about $13 million in annual sales operating a chain of relaxation salons throughout Japan.

Founded in 2017 by Wang Anquan, an alum of Alibaba and Xiaomi (the world's third-largest smartphone maker), Webull is somewhat of a Robinhood clone. It's zero-commission trading platform boasts more than 17 million users globally, per a May 2023 press release, with, according to a FINRA database, 86 registered brokers scattered across offices in New York, St. Petersburg, Florida, and Changsha, China. And while it might not be a household name like Robinhood, sports fans likely recognize Webull because it pays $30 million a year to have its logo on Brooklyn Nets jerseys.

But it's Webull's financial ties to Xiaomi, the company that was an early backer of its parent company, that raises eyebrows in political circles. A 2020 Forbes investigation on how Xiaomi collected and stored its users data set off privacy alarms for cybersecurity researchers. Then, three years later, in the last days of the Trump administration, Xiaomi landed on a U.S. Department of Defense blacklist, flagged for its supposed ties to the People's Liberation Army (an accusation the company denied). That didn't last long, however. By May of 2021, the Biden Pentagon rescinded the decision in response to a lawsuit filed by the company. But that hasn't eased concerns.

Former Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin expressed his doubts about Webull's data security given its connection to Xiaomi in a 2023 Washington Times op-ed. Zeldin highlighted that Chinese law could force companies like Webull to surrender data to the CCP, potentially compromising American users' personal information. Zeldin argued that this leaves Webull's operations and the security of American investors' data out of U.S. regulatory reach, casting a shadow over the platform's trustworthiness.

Webull did not respond to requests for comment.

While enticing story stocks like Jin Medical can soar to valuations that defy financial logic, the risks of manipulation and extreme volatility in thinly-traded microcaps is high.

'Follow the money. You basically need at least two groups involved to make one of these things fly: the underwriters and the issuers,' says James Angel, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. 'These penny-stock IPOs are pretty small, but apparently underwriters have found a way to market them.' Webull is an active dealer, but it has plenty of company. Irvine, California's Boustead Securities is an underwriter, notorious for its 'hot' IPOs according to a website called IPO Warriors.

Retail investors' long history of investing in penny stock IPOs has not been good. In a recent study called 'Lawful But Awful' by OTC Markets Group, a company that now runs an electronic version of what used to be known as the 'Pink Sheets', the 91 microcap deals that came public in 2022 were down on average 65% average as of August 2023. That's no anomaly. In 2022, Bloomberg reported that Robinhood's IPO listings also had dismal performance. Of the 23 IPOs offered, including Robinhood's own, every one of them was down by double digits at press time.

'What I suspect is going on is a little bit of the speculator's greater fool theory,' says Georgetown's Angel. 'Investors say they'll get in on one of these dodgy things, and the manipulators play their games. When one of these stocks with a limited float takes off, it forces the index providers to buy in at inflated prices. The people that get hurt when the stock inevitably drops are the innocent bystanders in index funds.' Some of these microcap IPOs have found homes in broad-based ETFs like Fidelity's $6 billion ONEQ which tracks the Nasdaq Composite and iShares $50 billion ITOT which captures Nasdaq and NYSE listings.

Prime Number Capital, the underwriter behind Jin Medical's sizzling stock offering was founded in 2018 by Xiaoyan Jiang, an ex-BNP Paribas executive who's firm boasts blue chip Wall Street credentials from places like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. On its website, Prime Number lists that it has completed 19 i nitial public offerings, raising a total of $1.6 billion. The company also boasted of a posh Manhattan office at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, with 'fabulous views of Central Park.' But a Google search reveals that the second floor, where they claimed their office was located, is actually a coworking space.

Jin Medical, with its recent 3,000% surge, has been a home run for Prime Number. Virtually all of its other offerings have been losers to the tune of negative 65% return on average. Only one of its 19 IPO stocks besides Jin, a Los Angeles-based vaporizer company called Ispire Technology, is currently trading above its day one closing price. Five of Prime Number's latest six stock offerings have found their way onto Webull's IPO calendar, though Jin Medical isn't one of them.

Jin Medical may not be a shining outlier for much longer. In December, Nasdaq served the company a delisting notice. Despite its share run-up and $1.73 billion market cap, the company's stock is concentrated among so few holders that it fails to meet the exchange's requirement of a minimum of 300 public shareholders who each own at least 100 shares. Jin will plead its case before a Nasdaq panel in March.

Can Xi Jinping win back the markets?,The Economist,2024-02-08 10:02:29,full,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/08/can-xi-jinping-win-back-the-markets,economist.com,Investors at home and abroad no longer trust China's policymakers,"T
hIS YEAR 
investors in Chinese stocks have been on a hair-raising ride. Even as America's 
S
&
P
 500 index reached record highs, markets in China and Hong Kong shed $1.5trn in January alone. Retail investors have taken to Chinese social media to vent their frustration. So brutal was the slump that on February 6th China's president, Xi Jinping, was reportedly to be briefed; the next day Yi Huiman, the head of China's securities regulator, was sacked. Prices recovered a little as state firms began buying stocks. In the coming days they may rise further still.
Step back, though, and there is no mistaking the dismal bigger picture. The market value of China's and Hong Kong's equities is down by nearly $7trn since its peak in 2021—a fall of around 35%, even as that of America's stocks has risen by 14%, and India's by 60%. The decline signals a fundamental problem. Investors abroad and at home once saw China's government as a dependable steward of the economy. Now this trust has seeped away, with severe consequences for China's growth.
Less than a decade ago the mood in China's markets was ebullient. Foreign investors were eager to tap into the potential of the world's rising economic star. China was expanding at a steady and impressive clip of over 6% a year. Foreign portfolio investment rushed in as offshore investors were given direct access to Chinese stocks via Hong Kong in 2014. Four years later 
msci, 
a financial firm, began including mainland stocks in its global indices. China's government, for its part, hoped to professionalise its markets in order to attract foreign capital and expertise, and to build an asset class to supplant property. A cohort of wealthy businesspeople and investors were emerging who had been exhorted by Mr Xi himself to live the China dream.
The implicit understanding was that, whatever China's politics, its officials could be trusted to steer the economy towards prosperity. China would continue to grow at an enviable pace, its citizens would still put wealth and economic stability above political freedoms, and foreign investors would reap handsome returns. Everyone could get rich.
What has gone wrong? One widely noted problem is Mr Xi's skittish policymaking. A regulatory crackdown on tech that began in 2020 knocked investors' confidence. The emergence from zero-covid was a fiasco. The government has vacillated over a property crisis that has sapped savings and sentiment and dragged the economy into deflation, with prices falling in the year to January at their fastest rate since the financial crisis of 2007-09. It rightly wants to avoid reinflating a bubble. But it also wants to avoid handouts and to focus growth on 'high quality' sectors that it believes will help China rival America's technological, economic and military might. Profits were down last year even in these sectors, however. And 
China lacks the stimulus
 it needs.
Less appreciated is how much foreign investors have fallen out of love with China. They must contend not only with poor policymaking, but also the risk that its worsening relationship with America could jeopardise their investments. They have been net sellers of mainland stocks for months. Whereas asset managers once cheered on China's inclusion in global indices, they are now crafting products that leave it out. Instead, investors are eyeing up India, with its large population, and Japan, with its cutting-edge technology. Hong Kong, too, has suffered. Companies from the mainland account for three-quarters of its market capitalisation. On January 22nd India briefly overtook it to become the world's fourth-biggest stockmarket.
Most worrying of all is that investors on the mainland are also losing confidence. After three decades of extraordinary growth, China's wealthy are experiencing a painful reversal in fortunes, as our Briefing this week reports. Both their property and their financial investments are sinking, and surveys indicate that many white-collar workers received pay cuts last year. The evidence suggests that more capital is flowing out of China. Those who cannot get round China's capital controls are moving into safer money-market funds, or fleeing into funds listed on the mainland that track foreign stocks.
All this will deal a blow to China's growth. Our analysis of household surveys suggests that a small but influential group of people hold most of China's financial assets. Their straitened circumstances will have knock-on effects, by reducing consumption and weighing on investment decisions. Investors trapped in the mainland may have little choice but to put some of their hard-earned cash into stocks. Foreigners, by contrast, may be harder to tempt back. That will come at a cost to China, even though foreign investors still own a small share of its equities. Over the years they have provided a useful external check on asset prices. over, their entry into the market a decade ago was associated with more capital spending and investment in research and development by Chinese firms. Their departure, conversely, could hurt innovation.
Mr Xi seems to know that something is going wrong. In addition to sacking Mr Yi, the government has curbed short-selling, and state-owned asset managers have been ordered to 
buy stocks
 . This may prop up stock prices for a time. But such meddling only betrays China's mistrust of markets, underlining why investors have left.
Far from embracing the need for broad change, Mr Xi is making things worse. At home, he is cracking down on criticism of the economy. At the same time, China is becoming more suspicious of foreign businesses. Financial data are becoming harder for offshore investors to obtain. In December new rules on the gaming industry were proposed, only to be quietly removed after markets reacted badly. In January the central bank declined to cut interest rates, despite continued deflation, catching out markets. All of this serves only to frighten investors.
The real obstacle to change is Mr Xi's iron belief that he and the Communist Party must be in total control. Regaining investors' trust requires a rethink of the state's role in the economy. But Mr Xi is unlikely to soften his grip. Investors once thought that China's politics need not encroach on their ability to make money. Now that they know there is no escaping politics, they will tread more fearfully.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.
Consumer prices across 
China
 are falling at the fastest pace in 15 years, as its economy struggles with weak demand.
China's consumer price index fell 0.8% year-on-year in January, data released this morning showed. It's the fourth straight month of declines, and the biggest contraction since 2009 after the financial crisis.
The inflation rate was dragged down by falling food prices, which dropped by 5.9% year-on-year in January.
Pork prices dropped by 17%, and were a major drag on inflation, while fresh vegetables were 12.7% cheaper than a year ago and fruit cost 9.1% less.

says the markets have 'ostensibly reacted favourably' to disappointing Chinese price data.
 
While a very concerning sign for China's economy, which could be becoming entrenched in a debt and deflation cycle, the markets arguably responded in a positive way to the news.
 
Perhaps markets see the terribly low number as a potential catalyst for more muscular monetary or fiscal stimulus from the central government, which, up until this point, has been moderate in applying countercyclical policy.

"I write on the key issues for global energy, with a focus on LATAM.",Elias Ferrer,2024-02-06 22:33:30,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2024/02/06/is-the-barbados-agreement-broken/,forbes.com,"The Barbados Agreement contained a section on ensuring a free and fair election, that both the Venezuelan government and the Unitary Platform agreed to in writing.","As part of a policy of engagement with Venezuela, the Biden administration supported the signing of the ' Barbados Agreement ' in October 2023, between Venezuela's government and the largest opposition coalition, the Unitary Platform.

The accords have come under strain after the Venezuelan Supreme Court ratified the public office ban on Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's candidate after she won primaries in October by a landslide. Since then, many of her supporters and U.S. political figures have said that there cannot be fair elections without her candidacy.

The Supreme Court argued that Machado had represented a third country—Panama—while she was a sitting member at the National Assembly; that she supported the seizure of Venezuelan overseas assets; and called for sanctions and a military intervention. Machado argues that she was never formally notified of the ban and that it is politically motivated; it is therefore not legally valid.

In a public speech shortly after the Supreme Court decision, the candidate stated, 'Without me, there is no election.' The U.S. government has reimposed sanctions on gold mining, and is threatening to do the same with oil and gas, unless President Nicolas Maduro reverses the decision.

Gerardo Blyde, the lead negotiator of the Unitary Platform, has said that the Maduro government 'partially violated the Barbados Agreement' due to the process that was carried out. In his view, there should have been a proper trial behind the Supreme Court's decision. Nonetheless, Blyde called to continue in the negotiation and electoral process, sticking to the path set out by the deal between the government and the opposition.

Interpreting the Barbados Agreement

The Barbados Agreement contained a section on ensuring a free and fair election, that both the Venezuelan government and the Unitary Platform agreed to in writing.

The text, shared by the Norwegian government, said that 'the authorization of all presidential candidates and political parties will be promoted, as long as they meet the requirements established to take part in a presidential election, consistent with the procedures established by Venezuelan law.'

Machado initially refused to challenge her ban, as she claimed that it was illegal. However, she appealed on December 15 th, likely after pressure from the U.S. government.

In a televised interview, Vice Minister William Castillo, a signatory of the Barbados Agreement, said that in the deal 'We did not sign any names. We had a general mechanism, and the Supreme Court said that this person did not meet the requirements, so they ratified the ban [on Machado].'

Chris Sabatini, senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, argues that 'despite rhetoric from Republicans and some members of the opposition, reinstating Machado was never part of the deal. It was to establish a process to determine her eligibility. The Supreme Court's decision didn't even meet a minimum threshold of the rule of law, but it didn't violate the agreement.'

In a public statement, Manuel Rosales, the governor of Zulia, said that 'we must support and promote [the Barbados Agreement]. Zulia is an opposition stronghold, and Rosales is also the leader of one of four core parties in the Unitary Platform. 'This is where we will define the electoral route, respect between adversaries, the return of oil and gas multinationals, and the release of political prisoners'.

'For the sake of the U.S., the international community and the Venezuelan opposition, they should avoid creating a zero-sum game breaking all possible options,' says Sabatini. 'Neither electoral conditions nor sanctions need to be a binary option.'

How could US-Venezuela relations progress?

The U.S. has sent Jon Finer and Juan Gonzalez to Colombia, where they have renewed negotiations with the Venezuelan government in private. They also hope President Gustavo Petro can help mediate.

U.S. government officials have by and large been nuanced, saying that they support the right of the opposition to present a candidate. It is less clear whether lifting the ban on Machado is a necessary condition for a free and fair election.

Francisco Palmieri has said that the U.S. will support lifting the ban on Maria Corina Machado. Palmieri is the Chief of Mission of Venezuelan Affairs Unit in the U.S. Embassy in Colombia. He also said that 'the Barbados Agreement is still in force'.

'For the sake of the U.S., the international community and the Venezuelan opposition, they should avoid creating a zero-sum game breaking all possible options,' says Sabatini. 'Neither electoral conditions nor sanctions need to be a binary option.'

Geoff Ramsey, senior fellow on Venezuela and Colombia at the Atlantic Council, says that 'the Biden administration has repeatedly said that this election is about a process, not about a single person. Right now, Machado has no incentive to talk about a replacement candidate, but it has been an open secret in opposition circles for months that a plan B is needed.'

'As the clear winner of the opposition primary, she is the only one who can credibly endorse a substitute—so her buy-in is crucial.' Ramsey expects that to happen 'when she is ready, and once there is progress on the more technical electoral commitments made in the Barbados Agreement.'

Furthermore, Ramsey believes that 'there is still a good chance that we can get to elections that all relevant actors, including the Maduro government, opposition, and international community, can recognize. Progress will require a commitment to the parts of the Barbados Agreement that are clearly defined, including the presence of international observers, an update of the electoral registry, and setting a date for elections in late 2024 that allows for the full implementation of Venezuelan electoral law.'

Luis Vicente Leon, economist and president of polling firm Datanalisis, believes that the U.S. is treading a thin line when using the threat of sanctions. 'The Maduro government reacts badly to ultimatums. In the event of a total breakdown of relations with the U.S., Maduro could fall back on a closed election or even cancel the vote. We could have a Nicaragua-style election.'

'Maduro clearly believes he can use sanctions relief to mobilize resources and juice support for the ruling party,' says Ramsey. 'If that possibility is taken away, I think he loses any incentive to organize an election that the US would recognize.'

Venezuelan economist Asdrubal Oliveros projected that if oil sanctions are renewed in April, GDP growth for 2024 would be revised down from 9.6% to 4%. State revenues would also fall by $4 billion—in an economy of just under $100 billion.

If sanctions persist, they could delay Venezuela's economic recovery, with implications for the mass exodus of Venezuelans. The flow of oil and gas from the South American country is also important for Western countries' efforts to diversify their energy supply.

Ricardo Penfold, a Venezuelan economist and chief strategist at Seaport Global, believes that the U.S. immigration crisis and the invasion of Ukraine have brought Venezuela back to international significance. 'President Maduro is capitalizing on his relatively strengthened position, testing the boundaries of Washington D.C.'s red lines.'

The apprehension of Venezuelans entering the U.S. illegally dropped by 46% in October. A key factor could be the agreements between the Maduro and Biden administrations. However, migration is likely to persist in similar numbers if the economic and political landscape in Venezuela remains the same. Migration deals are also at risk if sanctions are reimposed, as Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has said.

Penfold thinks that 'there might be factions within chavismo seeking a transition that ensures their survival and reintegrates Venezuela into the global economy. Is the U.S. strategically playing the long game, capable of collaborating with them? Additionally, chavismo and the opposition looking towards the future, working to establish an institutional framework that guarantees their coexistence?'

‘Nowhere else to go': protesters rally in support of Brisbane woman refusing to leave rental home of 22 years,Eden Gillespie,2024-02-06 14:00:33,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/stephanie-cridland-no-fault-eviction-protest-rally-brisbane,theguardian.com,Stephanie Cridland's story of no-fault eviction one of many as renters' advocates raise concerns amid growing housing crisis,"Stephanie Cridland has lived in the same Brisbane rental property for more than 20 years.
The 51-year-old lives with her dog and pet fish in an old Queenslander
but after receiving notice to leave last year, she is concerned she'll end up on the street.
Cridland's dilemma prompted Greens candidate for Brisbane mayor, Jonathan Sriranganathan, on Tuesday to organise a snap anti-eviction protest outside Cridland's rental. It's one of several protests organised by the party in recent years in the wake of a rental crisis. Women aged 55 and over are especially vulnerable, with the number finding themselves homeless up almost 40% between 2011 and 2021, 
according to ABS data
.
Cridland, who has been paying $290 a week rent, has been looking for alternative accommodation since Christmas but can't afford the higher rents.
She has lodged a case with the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. 'I've got nowhere else to go,' she said. 'If I end up homeless, how do I look after a fish in a car?'
Her sister, Imogen Bunting, is concerned Cridland will be forced to leave before she finds stable accommodation.
'We'd like to see an end to no-fault evictions and to make sure that particularly older women, who are the largest growing cohort of homeless [people], aren't evicted, ' she said.
Cridland's story is not unusual. In 2022 
Guardian Australia reported 
on Bernie Maloney, a pensioner who inspired a civil disobedience campaign to stop forced evictions after he was asked to leave the Milton home he had been renting for a decade.
The Greens want rent caps, and a ban on no-grounds evictions for fixed-term leases.

The 
Miles government
 has announced a suite of rental reforms in the past week, including a ban on rent bidding and an additional $390m in funding for homelessness services.
Sriranganathan said the changes were a 'minor improvement' but more radical action was needed.
'The changes definitely don't go far enough and they wouldn't really help someone like Stephanie in this situation,' Sriranganathan told Guardian Australia.
'She has been evicted without grounds … What we really need to see is the complete freeze on rent increases and rules against kicking tenants out for no reason.'
Sriranganathan last month expressed support for East Brisbane resident, Mina, who refused to move out of her rental after a landlord issued a notice to leave at the end of tenancy.
'It's obviously a tough call, because if you refuse to move, you risk getting blacklisted,' he said.
'But there are lots of people who would rightly argue that being on a blacklist for a couple of years is still better than sleeping in a tent or car, especially during heatwaves and summer storms.'
Tenants Queensland and the Queensland Council of Social Service
 
(QCOSS) have raised concerns about 'arbitrary evictions' and rent increases, which they say have not been addressed by the state government.
Tenants Queensland chief executive, Penny Carr, said under current laws tenants could be evicted from their home for no reason at the end of a lease.
QCOSS chief executive, Aimee McVeigh, said renting in Queensland had become unaffordable for frontline workers.
'Our own workforce is struggling to pay the rent … The Queensland government can, and should, stop erratic and unaffordable rent increases,' she said in a statement.
Brendan Coates, an economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, said banning no-grounds evictions 'would be a big step forward'.
'There is no place for ‘no-grounds' evictions in the Australian rental market today,' he told Guardian Australia.
'The costs of having to move, against one's will, are substantial and asymmetric. A landlord misses out on rent for a short period, whereas a family can incur moving costs upwards of $6,000, along with the non-financial costs of finding a new home.'
Coates said no-grounds evictions could also deter tenants from exercising their rights, including asking for repairs or contesting a rent increase.
Asked about a ban on no-grounds evictions, the housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said she was focused on making reforms 'fair and balanced.'
'I acknowledge the sector wants those to go further. We will always talk to the sector around law reform,' she told the Queensland media club on Monday.
A former housing minister, Leeanne Enoch, 
said in 2021

Last year 21% of all vehicles sold in  were utes, with many used as family transport. But that could be about to change, with industry insiders warning that Labor's new vehicle efficiency standard will lead to some SUVs being discontinued or becoming more expensive. Popular models such as the Toyota Hilux and Ford Rangers, for example, would have to become 60% more fuel efficient to meet the new targets. More fuel efficient vehicles and EVs, meanwhile, look set to be cheaper. Toby Hagon, er, kicks the tyres on the new plans.

Tata was accused of not listening by the chair of committee Rajesh Nair appeared before
The boss of Tata Steel UK has robustly defended plans to close both its blast furnaces in Port Talbot, putting nearly 2,000 jobs there at risk of redundancy.
Tata intends installing an electric furnace, which would use recycled steel and need fewer workers to run.
Unions and politicians have called for at least one blast furnace to be kept open to maintain virgin steel making.
But Rajesh Nair said for technical and financial reasons ""there is no way the blast furnaces can be kept going"".
He appeared before the Senedd's economy committee whose chair, Conservative MS Paul Davies, described the session as ""deeply disheartening and devastating for Wales' steel industry"".
Mr Nair told Senedd members the blast furnaces, to 
close this year under the plans
, and other facilities at the plant were ""towards the end of life"" and their ""reliability is compromised"".
He said it there was a need to proceed with the electric arc plans ""at pace"" as the business was set to be in the red by £500m this financial year ""if nothing else were to go wrong"".
The new electric furnace would be built within a facility used in the steel-making process, a steel shop, he said, meaning the blast furnaces would have to close during the transition to a greener form of production.
""If you don't have a steel shop that is operating, there is no way the blast furnaces can be kept going,"" said Mr Nair.

Rajesh Nair said Tata's plans were considered ""very, very carefully""
The closure of the blast furnaces would also affect workers in Llanwern in Newport, Shotton in Flintshire, Trostre in Carmarthenshire and Swansea University, as well as several sites in England.
Committee chair Mr Davies later accused Tata of being ""unequivocal"" and ""not listening"" despite ""huge opposition, and the terrible effects the closure of the blast furnaces will have on the workforce, their families and communities across south Wales"".
""This week the whole Senedd unanimously agreed that there is a viable future for the blast furnace - this has been completely ignored,"" he said.
""Today we are calling on Tata to reconsider their position and to keep the blast furnace open.""
Earlier in the committee, Wales' Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said conversations continued between Tata, the Welsh and UK governments and leading Labour figures at Westminster.
Mr Gething, one of two candidates to be Welsh Labour leader and first minister, added: ""I think it is important to recognise that I don't think this is a done deal, and I don't think this is something where there is absolutely zero chance of a different future.""

The Mayor of Bedford has unveiled other potential routes for the  (EWR) project through the borough.
EWR has already announced its preferred route, linking Oxford and Cambridge via a new track running through Bedford to the north.
Conservative Tom Wootton has defended spending £40,000 to commission consultants to explore alternative routes to the south.
Their report concluded that all options would boost the Bedford economy.
The mayor reflected: ""While there is no definitive winner among the proposed routes, the economic potential of the project for Bedford is significant.""

EWR's proposed Route E between Bedford and Cambridge shows three new railway stations to be built by EWR, including the rebuilding of Bedford St Johns
In a meeting at Borough Hall, the mayor said he had commissioned the study in response to EWR announcing its preferred route last May.
The EWR route going through Bedford to the north was one of the eight routes considered by consultants.
A map included in the report shows the other potential routes running close to places including Shortstown, Elstow and through Priory Country Park.
It evaluated each route against 13 criteria, including environmental considerations and potential demolitions.
Consultants SLC Rail explained that deciding on a preferred route was ""finely balanced"". 
They added: ""However, we believe that a southern route option... could be feasible if further development work were undertaken to resolve some of the current deficiencies.
""In all options  represents a sizeable boost to the economy in Bedford worth between £257m and £268m over 60 years.""

Mr Wootton defended spending taxpayers money on the study, when a preferred route has already been announced.
He said: ""As many houses are knocked down, as many houses are blighted, they'd expect their council to be looking after their interests, and fighting their corner.""
EWR chief executive Beth West said they had a ""preferred route"" and they would be ""trying to progress on that"".
She added: ""Of course we will read Mayor Tom's report, we haven't done that yet, and we will take any new information we receive very seriously.""

Row erupts over cost of Labour's home insulation plan,Chas Geiger,2024-02-07 18:45:08,full,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68232370,bbc.co.uk,"The government claims the scheme could cost £15bn a year but Labour calls the figure ""bogus"".","Image source,

Labour has rejected as ""bogus"" an analysis by government officials that its plan to improve home energy efficiency would cost £12-15bn a year.
The party has said the measures, part of a wider £28bn green investment plan, would be capped at £6bn a year. 
But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the analysis showed Labour's proposals were likely to cost ""a lot more"". 
Ahead of a general election, Tory ministers have repeatedly targeted Labour's spending pledges. 
In recent weeks, there has been some 
confusion about Labour's commitment to increase spending on green projects to £28bn
 during the second half of the next parliament, if they win power.
The Conservatives say this would force up taxes and hit economic growth. 
Labour 
argues kickstarting a transition to a green economy would foster low-carbon growth and jobs
. Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer restated his commitment to the £28bn figure, subject to the party's fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and to close the deficit on day-to-day spending. 
Mr Hunt said the Conservatives had created 800 jobs a day since 2010 and the UK economy had recovered from the Covid pandemic ""far better than most people predicted"". 
A Labour ""borrowing splurge"", he argued, would put that at risk with £28bn a year equivalent to four pence on income tax, and mean there was less money for the NHS and other public services. 
The official costings of the Labour plan to insulate 19 million homes in a decade were produced by civil servants in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and 
published by the Treasury on the government website
. 
Labour, which says its measures would reduce household energy bills, said the £12-15bn figure was ""ludicrous and uses bogus assumptions"". 
""They have costed someone else's policy,"" a spokesperson added. 
The party said it rejected an assumption that all improvements would be government-funded, adding its proposals would involve a mixture of grants for low-income households and low-interest loans for others.
It stressed that a description of the plan as an ""uncapped, fully Exchequer-funded, undifferentiated model"" did not fit with its policy.
Labour also emphasised that its ""National Warm Homes Plan"" would be a voluntary scheme, and that no household would be forced to participate. 
However, the document's findings were seized on by Rishi Sunak in his exchanges with Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister's Questions.
The analysis found around £2bn a year was ""currently committed in the next Parliament for home energy efficiency, heat decarbonisation and public sector decarbonisation combined"".
This is by no means the first time an opposition has clashed with the government over its use of officially-produced statistics in an election year.
Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, said such costings were a ""long-standing convention"", but also a ""political tool"".
""Costing opposition policies has happened since at least the 1950s. It's very much a political tool.
""The Treasury only do the calculations based on assumptions about the policy which have to be given to them by ministers or special advisers,"" she wrote on X. 
In another post on X, former Treasury permanent secretary Lord Macpherson suggested these costings should be ignored.
""Over the next 9 months, we will have to [tolerate] many an 'official Treasury' costing of Opposition policy.
""Since time immemorial, whatever the party in power, these costings have had little if any credibility. Political advisers determine the assumptions. #rubbishinrubbishout,"" he said.

Reckless or reasonable? Factchecking the claims of anti-renewable activists,Sarah Basford Canales,2024-02-07 14:00:51,full,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/08/parliament-house-protest-renewable-energy-plan-barnaby-joyce-pauline-hanson-matt-canavan-craig-kelly,theguardian.com,A protest at Parliament House featured claims about higher bills and dystopian images of disused turbines. But is there any basis for this?,"Community groups, activists and politicians rallied on the lawns of Parliament House on Tuesday in opposition to the federal government's plan for the energy grid to run on 82% renewable energy by 2030.

Dubbed the 'Reckless Renewables Rally', the protest saw familiar opponents of action on climate change, including Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce, One Nation's leader, Pauline Hanson, Nationals senator Matt Canavan and former Liberal MP Craig Kelly.

The anti-renewables movement has already been caught spreading misinformation. Guardian Australia reported in November how a false claim about wind turbines killing whales had ripped through the group's discussions on social media.

Here are some of the key claims made throughout the rally and the facts behind them.

Claim: renewables don't produce reliable energy

A common myth spread by renewable energy opponents is solar and windfarms are unreliable because they can only generate electricity when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing.

Solar and wind energy are known as variable sources of electricity, because they vary depending on the weather conditions. But that does not mean these sources are unreliable.

Energy system experts point out these issues are overcome by connecting many sources of wind and solar that are geographically spread around the country to the grid.

Excess electricity generated by wind and solar will also be stored in batteries, or used to pump water uphill at hydroelectric plants. That energy can be released later when it is needed, such as during times of peak demand.

The Australian Energy Market Operator consults with the energy industry to produce a plan for the most reliable electricity system that will meet climate targets.

The latest draft of that plan says the electricity grid will need very large increases in storage – such as batteries and hydroelectric projects. But there will also be an increase in gas-fired plants that will sit as backup.

Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at UNSW, says focusing on the reliability of a single generating technology is 'missing the point'.

He said: 'Coal power is sometimes unreliable too and [power plants] trip out often. Reliability is actually a characteristic of the entire system. The idea is that we are building a system that's reliable.'

Claim: decommissioned windfarms will end up in landfill

Some rally attenders expressed concern over how windfarms would be decommissioned, with some speakers evoking imagery of Mad Max-like wastelands filled with rusting machinery. Others have said wind turbines and blades will end up in landfill.

According to a Clean Energy Council report released last year, around 85% to 94% of a wind turbine's mass is recyclable.

The report also discusses alternative options for windfarms due for decommissioning after an expected 25-year lifespan, including an extension of life or upgrading parts.

Major global windfarm operator Acciona runs five windfarms in Australia and is building a sixth, with about 400 turbines and 1,200 blades under its portfolio. An Acciona spokesperson said: 'The argument that projects would be abandoned and left to rust is an invention.'

They said rather than energy producers abandoning sites, in Europe – where the industry is mature – operators were 'repowering sites' and replacing turbines to continue to generate electricity.

In Spain, Acciona is building a recycling facility for turbine blades which is expected to open next year.

'We're looking at options here in Australia to set up similar capability for us and the industry,' the spokesperson added.

Claim: more than 60% of your power bill is transmission power line costs which will increase substantially with renewables

A common claim, including by Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce, was that 60% of a power bill's costs is due to the transmission between a power generator and homes or businesses.

The claim then suggests thousands of kilometres of transmission towers and power lines will need to be built to connect wind and solar farms to consumers.

But the claim appears to be exaggerated, according to fact sheets and reports by the Australian Energy Regulator.

In November 2023, it found that around 8% of a retail electricity bill's cost is transmission while 35% is related to distribution expenses. Together, the costs are less than half of the average national energy bill.

McConnell said it was possible that the proportion of bills related to transmission costs may rise slightly, but he added: 'The flip side is that you will allow more lower-cost renewables into the system.'

Claim: the renewables rollout is a $121bn threat to the economy

Another claim focused on 'excessive' economic costs associated with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. In a rally press release, it was claimed the rollout is 'posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121bn'.

The figure comes from a December report from the Australian Energy Market Operator, which stated the annualised capital cost of all generation, storage, firming and transmission infrastructure under the 'optimal development path' to decarbonise the electricity system had a present value of $121bn.

Those figures relate to the National Electricity Market covering all states and territories except WA and the NT.

About $16.4bn of that amount was related to transmission projects, which AEMO said would 'pay themselves back and deliver the additional $17bn net market benefit noted above.'

But Alison Reeve, an energy expert at the Grattan Institute, said claiming the $121bn was a 'cost' was a misrepresentation.

She said: 'It's actually $121bn of economic activity. That's jobs and materials. It's not a threat to the economy. It is part of the economy. The much bigger threat would be an electricity system that doesn't work.'

Even if there was no need to decarbonise the electricity grid, Reeve said there would still have to be major investments in the electricity system.

'We would still have to replace coal fired power stations – which are not cheap – and would probably be replaced with renewables and gas anyway. Avoiding spending money would mean accepting the lights would go out more often and would mean we can't use any more electricity than we do now.'

Claim: Australians will pay more for renewables rather than just sticking with fossil fuels

Another repeated claim was that there would be an increase in bills because of the commitment to 82% renewable energy by 2030. For example, transmission lines and batteries would need to be built over the next six years, costing more than just sticking with coal and gas power.

However, the latest figures in CSIRO's GenCost report counter those claims. The report has found that even when the costs of integrating renewables into the system are accounted for, solar and wind remain the cheapest form of electricity.

CSIRO's report found the cheapest form of electricity for 2023 is still a mix of wind and solar power coming in at between $94 and $134 per megawatt hour. It forecasts the price to fall between $69 and $101 per megawatt hour by 2030.

In comparison, black coal in 2023 is between $110 and $217 per megawatt hour and forecasted to drop to $86 to $137 per megawatt hour by 2030.

Black coal power, using carbon capture and storage techniques, in 2023 was costed between $193 and $364 per megawatt hour. In 2030, it drops to between $161 and $256.

Small modular nuclear reactors are yet to be developed commercially but are advocated by the Coalition and were promoted at the anti-renewables rally. The GenCost report found even if they were to become commercially available, they would likely be the most expensive form of electricity.

Claim: renewables will take up prime agricultural land

Some farmers at the rally complained that renewables were taking away 'prime agricultural land', threatening food production.

This is a variation on a claim promoted by mining magnate Gina Rinehart and the Institute for Public Affairs that up to one-third of agricultural land in Australia was under threat from renewables.

But renewable energy supporters have said this is a gross exaggeration. The NSW agriculture commissioner has said the total area of rural land to be converted to renewable energy production was likely to be about 55,000ha – or 0.1% of rural land in the state.

The Clean Energy Council has said if you were to theoretically replace all the country's coal fired power plants with solar farms, this would require about 0.016% of the country's land area, equivalent to 0.027% of agricultural land.

In a statement, Acciona said its projects were on farm properties 'with the agreement and support of the host landowner' and typically only about 3% of a property was actually used, mostly by access roads.

The spokesperson said: 'Farmers freely and happily use the access roads to traverse the property and muster livestock. Our landowners have welcomed our projects to diversify their incomes and get better yields from their property.

"Right to disconnect from work laws a step closer as Labor agrees to deal, Greens say",Paul Karp,2024-02-07 03:23:55,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/australia-right-to-switch-off-laws-industrial-relations-changes-labor-greens,theguardian.com,"Adam Bandt says changes to industrial relations bill mean ‘when you clock off, you'll be able to switch off'","Labor's so-called 'closing loopholes' bill is a step closer to passing parliament after a deal with the Greens that includes 
a right to disconnect from work for employees
.
On Wednesday the Greens announced the Albanese government had accepted the right to disconnect, which will prevent employees being punished for refusing to take unreasonable work calls or answer emails in their unpaid personal time.
The Greens leader, 
Adam Bandt
, said the changes mean 'when you clock off, you'll be able to switch off'.
'Unless you are getting paid for it … you should be able to ignore those calls and those messages that come in,' he told reporters in Canberra.
The Greens workplace relations spokesperson, Barbara Pocock, said the new right applies to 'all employees' but the amendment 'won't disturb all kinds of changes where people are paid to be on call or where their job description requires it or where there's an emergency'.
Pocock said the amendment would allow 'reasonable contact' including 'if there is a particular need like a change in your working conditions you need to know about, [a change] in your place or time of work'.
She said employees who believed they were being contacted unreasonably would first take the issue up with their employer and, if it is not resolved, can then go to the Fair Work Commission for a stop order, punishable by a fine if the employer does not comply.
'The right to disconnect has to be enforceable,' she said. 'A worker has got to have some backup when they say ‘that's not OK to contact me seven times on a Sunday', as a nurse recently said to me, [in an instance of] unpaid contact.'

Pocock said the changes would be phased in over six months, to give employers time to 'adapt, listen and learn', with a longer phase-in for small business.
With the support of the Greens' 11 Senate votes and the independent Lidia Thorpe, Labor needs just one more vote – likely to come from David Pocock – to pass its bill.
Thorpe on Wednesday said that she had reached a deal with Labor in return for changes to casual provisions.
In December Pocock and the Jacqui Lambie Network 
combined to help pass the same job, same pay provisions
 of the closing loopholes bill but delayed the 
gig economy
, road transport industry and casual work provisions until 2024.
In a Senate committee report on Thursday, Pocock and Lambie both expressed reservations with the remainder of the closing loopholes bill.
Lambie's concerns included the extension of unions' right of entry to investigate wage theft, the Fair Work Commission's ability to order minimum conditions for truck owner-drivers, and changes to the intractable bargaining regime.

The latter 
had also raised the ire of the Victorian treasurer
, Tim Pallas, who warned that a Greens amendment, accepted by workplace relations minister Tony Burke, would guarantee unions 'will be no worse off on a clause by clause basis'.
Pocock called on the government to narrow the gig economy reforms, which he warned go 'far beyond the scope of capturing the gig platform courier drivers and would impact sectors like personal and aged-care providers'.
On Wednesday Lambie urged the government not to guillotine debate to force a Senate vote this sitting, but Pocock suggested the bill was ready to be considered and praised the government for its constructive negotiations.
Lambie cast doubt on the need for the right to disconnect, telling ABC Radio National that 'nobody has ever spoken to me in the 10 years I've been in and out of politics, about phone calls after hours, not one person'.
Anthony Albanese defended the principle on Wednesday.
'What we're simply saying is, someone who's not being paid 24 hours a day shouldn't be penalised if they're not online and available 24 hours a day,' he told reporters in Canberra.
On Tuesday Burke said it was 'unreasonable' workers were expected to work out of office hours but it was reasonable for employers to send emails or contact people for shifts.

The Guardian view on the state pension age: mindlessly hiking it is not the answer,Editorial,2024-02-06 18:44:25,full,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-state-pension-age-mindlessly-hiking-it-is-not-the-answer,theguardian.com,Editorial: Just one in 11 men born today can expect to reach retirement age in good health. A system rethink is needed,"A
ll you need to know about Liz Truss offering lessons on how to be 
popular
 is that one of her signature policies is to raise the 
state pension age to 68
. Such is its vote-winning potential that the plan was ditched by Rishi Sunak's 
administration
 as soon as the electoral consequences became clear. The trouble is not that people are living longer, but that they are living longer with ill health. As it stands, the pension age will rise to 67 in April 2026. At the same time, there has been a sustained rise in people out of work because of sickness.
In Greek mythology, Cassandra had the gift of prophecy, but was cursed so no one listened to her. Those making the case that people should have to wait until they are 
71 to retire
 might feel aggrieved that they are being similarly dismissed while speaking the truth. But that fails to understand the hardship, alienation and anguish currently being experienced by the working-age population.
The 
Institute for Public Policy Research
 found, astonishingly, that just 9% of men and 16% of women born today can expect to reach state retirement age in good health. The poor not only die sooner, they also spend more of their lives with a long-term condition or disability. This is an avoidable, unfair difference with the rich that should be morally unacceptable.
By raising age limits, it means another year on working-age benefits rather than the relatively more generous state pension. 
Analysis
 by the Health Foundation suggests that people living in some of the most deprived areas in Scotland, the north-east, the east Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber would be the most disadvantaged by the upward drift in pensionable age.
If the argument is that more and more of us will live longer lives, but are not saving enough to enable us to consume after retirement, then the answer is to allow more people to have the money to put aside. Revitalising the NHS is key to strengthening the UK economy. But there needs to be a wider system rethink about employment conditions, pay and the dignity of work – not just blindly raising age limits with little care about inequality.
This 
week
, the Office for National Statistics found that there are now 2.8 million people classified as not looking for work because of health issues – a one-third increase on the 2.1 million before the pandemic. It ought to be a national mission to prevent human life on such a scale from going to waste. Bringing those resources back into the labour force would also, potentially, allow for more saving and reduce the need for raising pension limits precipitately. As would looser fiscal policy – one that prioritises humanity over arbitrary spending rules.
Voters get indignant when they feel an ethical norm is being violated. Governance should be an ethical matter. Electorates are not happy with being told to go along with policies regardless of how indefensible they are. No doubt many think that the next government will have to raise the retirement age once freed from the electoral cycle. Labour ought to have a plan to ensure that this is not 
 inevitable
, starting with targets to reduce poverty, obesity and anxiety – and increase healthy life expectancy. The 
evidence
 was that under the last Labour government such policies produced a fairer and healthier society. There's no reason to think they couldn't work again.",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Editorial,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/667f110d10b353977facfff30bc5cc39f4b40aef/0_171_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3c123630d03ce880621b855345f4752a,False,@guardian,4.066274,72e798130882237e7d5aefe405a55c34,"['state pension age', 'health', 'inequality', 'employment conditions', 'retirement age']","The article discusses the plan to raise the state pension age to 68, the impact of ill health on retirement, and the inequality in life expectancy.

Arcanum Capital Disrupts Web3 Venture Capital With 'Circular Economy',Christos Makridis,2024-02-07 14:00:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2024/02/07/arcanum-capital-disrupts-web3-venture-capital-with-circular-economy/,forbes.com,"Arcanum Capital launches its second fund, the Arcanum Luganodes Fund, focusing on early and growth-stage Web3 investments with leading staking provider Luganodes.","Arcanum Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on seed-stage investments in the Web3 sector, just announced its second fund, the Arcanum Luganodes Fund. Arcanum Capital was established in 2020 by James McDowall, Luchang Zheng, Karthik Bupathi, and Rahul Andra with an initial focus on very early-stage investments.

The new fund is focused on further early stage investments, as well as more established growth-stage investments at higher valuations, with this renewed focus being made possible by Arcanum's collaboration with Luganodes which is one of the world's leading ‘staking services' providers. Luganodes, led by its CEO Anuj Shankar, is a Swiss-operated, institutional-grade, non-custodial staking provider born out of the Lugano Plan B Program, an initiative driven by Tether and the City of Lugano. Luganodes is the world's fastest growing staking provider with over $1 billion of staked assets under management across over 30 proof of stake networks. ""The partnership with Luganodes will help Fund II gain access to some of the most sought-after Layer 1 and Layer 2 investment opportunities in the space and enable us to add even more value to our portfolio networks,' said Zheng.

Arcanum leverages traditional investment strategies to support innovative startups, backed by proficient advisors Sandeep Nailwal, Lawrence Newhook, and Aniket Jindal, who are recognized figures.

Spearheading Early-Stage Innovation with Strategic Investments

The genesis of the Arcanum's Fund I came from inspiration by Tim Draper to Zheng, Andra (both of whom attended Draper University) and McDowall, leading to the firm's focus on active, mentorship-driven investing to aid startups in accessing funding, strategic partnerships, and market entry strategies. This approach, reminiscent of the successful models used by incubators like Y-Combinator, combines financial support with extensive networking and strategic guidance, aiming to accelerate the growth of their portfolio companies through network effects and economies of scale.

Fund I closed oversubscribed and included commitments from Draper, Nailwal of Polygon, and Polygon Ventures, as well as additional institutional investment from China, Switzerland, and Singapore. The initial thesis was to identify bold and brilliant – and in many cases younger – sometimes first-time entrepreneurs, and help take them from 'zero to one.'

One of the key highlights of Arcanum Fund I's early stage investments is Puffer Finance, which is an organization focused on Ethereum Liquid staking (a multi-billion dollar market segment). Arcanum's investment in Puffer reflects the team's capability to identify and source deal flow and lay the foundation for further capital infusion from globally renowned investors, like Lightspeed. In March 2022 when Puffer was called Portal, and before it had raised any capital at all, James and Rahul met Founder Amir for the first time at a private investor lunch in Dubai organized by Luchang, and knew almost immediately that Arcanum needed to back him and the team he wanted to build. In May, Arcanum became their first investors by providing pre-seed capital at a valuation of $30 million.

The team has now grown to become a blend of technology and community experts, including an ex-NASA lead engineer, an ex-Chainlink researcher, the former head of institutional staking at Coinbase, core contributors to Curve, and core Ethereum Foundation researchers, all united to forge the next era of Web3 infrastructure. As EigenLayer's sole official native liquid restaking partner for Ethereum, Puffer is set to revolutionize capital efficiency and reduce participation risks in EigenLayer apps.

Since Arcanum's investment, Puffer has been awarded a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Brevan Howard, Lemniscap, and Lightspeed Faction, and secured a strategic investment from Binance. Puffer has recently launched successfully and attracted over $350M in total value locked (TVL) in the first 3 days, and it is evident that Puffer is shaping up to be a victory for Arcanum with its clear potential for becoming another unicorn in the Web3 space.

'Arcanum's investment was pivotal in laying the groundwork for what Puffer has become today. Their support in our growth journey enabled us to forge significant partnerships that have been instrumental to our product's success,' said Amir Forouzani, Co-Founder and CEO of Puffer. 'They played a critical role in facilitating introductions to new investors and working with the team on the Puffer roadmap, execution strategies, and even the product. Their hands-on support led to a successful seed funding round, followed by a strategic investment from Binance… we will continue to work alongside Arcanum to devise optimal market entry strategies and navigate the evolving landscape of Web3,' Forouzani continued.

New Global-Focused Fund II with Strategic Expansion and Tokenization

While Arcanum Fund I was primarily focused on seed-stage investments in decentralized applications, Fund II will have a key focus on investing in and adding value to promising and upcoming Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, which provide the technical and economic infrastructure for decentralized applications to run on. 'We have always been passionate about being active investors and helping our portfolio companies as they grow and scale. Having Luganodes as a world-class infrastructure provider participating in testnets, running validator nodes, and operating even more scarce and technically challenging infrastructure components such as decentralized sequencers, whilst providing technical support along the way, will certainly add to our list of key differentiators from other investors in the industry,' said McDowall.

'We are delighted to announce Luganodes' collaboration with Arcanum Capital in the establishment of a transformative VC Fund. Arcanum Capital's unparalleled expertise in supporting innovative blockchain ventures aligns seamlessly with Luganodes' commitment to building a secure and decentralized internet. This strategic partnership is poised to strengthen our position in the industry and foster advancements in the global blockchain ecosystem,' said Anuj Shankar, CEO of Luganodes.

The second major difference from Fund I is that Fund II will be tokenized. Lawrence Newhook, a veteran investment professional with an over 30 year track record investing globally across all asset classes, will serve as a director of both Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund I and Fund II, in addition to his main role as President of DigitalArray ISAC Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled platform of regulated investment funds that facilitates the launch of institutional funds for best-in-class investment managers.

Arcanum will employ the digital securitization solution offered by DigitalArray's sister company, Laureate Digital Markets, to tokenize Fund II, providing investors the ability to easily sell their fund interests prior to the end of the Fund's term on a regulated secondary platform or peer-to-peer (subject to any required restrictions on transfer).

'Being able to frictionlessly trade illiquid real-world assets, such as investment funds, is a game-changer for investors,' said Newhook. 'Most of the few funds that have tokenized so far have issued tokens that are merely representative of something, like a share of an SPV/feeder. What we are providing for our closed-ended funds is the issuance of securities natively on-chain. Rather than a token that represents economic interests, the actual fund LP interests themselves are on-chain, allowing for instant settlement of funds. All the restrictions on transfer (e.g., regulatory, AML/ATF, investor whitelisting, contractual) can be built into the smart contract,' he continued. When all conditions are satisfied, the transfer happens without off-chain settlement. For a closed-end fund like Arcanum's Fund II, an investor can buy today and sell tomorrow, either peer-to-peer or on the secondary market, 'giving limited partners the potential for liquidity where it otherwise would not have been available to them.'

My research in the Frontiers of Blockchain has found that tokenization has the potential to democratize access to asset classes that would have traditionally only been in the hands of accredited investors. The result is greater access among retail investors and additional competition. 'Tokenization certainly lowers the barrier and opens the doors to broader public investment in the true spirit of blockchain technology,' Zheng said.",forbes.com,49,3,US,en,"Christos Makridis,Zenger News",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c1407084cc698298e42597/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,3.9687526,0e3118a16c9766d30ceb9c62072c7299,"['Arcanum Capital', 'venture capital', 'fund', 'investments', 'Web3']","Arcanum Capital announces its second fund, the Arcanum Luganodes Fund, focused on early-stage and growth-stage investments in the Web3 sector.

Will Mazda Continue To Make Rotary Engine Powered Cars?,Peter Lyon,2024-02-06 17:30:38,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlyon/2024/02/06/will-mazda-continue-to-make-rotary-engine-powered-cars/,forbes.com,"Mazda's legendary rotary engine has been officially reborn, but not quite in the way you might think. This is the future of the rotary.","Mazda's rotary engine has been officially reborn, but not quite in the way you might think. Yes, we saw a drop-dead gorgeous Iconic SP rotary-hybrid coupe concept unveiled at last October's Japan Mobility Show, which is the kind of car you might normally think of when you hear that the ‘rotary has been reborn.'

But the Hiroshima-based carmaker has its own way of doing things. What Mazda actually announced last week was the rebirth of the rotary engine development team, referred to internally as the ""RE Development Group,' with ‘RE' short for rotary engine.

So let's cut to the chase. That does not mean Mazda plans to make cars powered by rotary engines. It does mean however, that the firm will use rotary engines as generators to charge onboard batteries for future hybrid powertrains, which is exactly the type of powerplant that will propel the Iconic SP coupe.

The announcement is basically a progression from the recent debut of the rotary-hybrid Iconic SP concept with the company saying, 'The new RE Development Group will continue to evolve rotary engines used as generators, and will conduct research and development into the application of carbon-neutral fuels.' And to achieve that goal, the company has assembled a team of 36 engineers.

The rotary is Mazda's identity!

But the operative word here is—generator. To Mazda, the rotary is its soul. Its identity. With no other carmaker employing rotary engines, it wants to keep that identity alive. More than five out of ten engineers join the company because they idolized rotaries as kids. And that beloved rotary engine is now—whether Mazda staff like it or not—being transformed into a generator.

Let us go back a dozen years to the rotary engine-powered RX-8, the last car to feature a full-blooded rotary without a hybrid system. It went out of production in 2012, partly because of its poor fuel economy, high emissions and high oil consumption. So yes, that's the reason why the rotary engine had to be re-defined and reinvented to keep it alive.

Re-established on February 1, 2024, the ""RE Development Group' engineers have actually been working on a next-generation rotary engine and hybrid system for the past six years. As an official team now, Mazda says the 36 engineers will come together as a single unit to advance the study and creation of RE for future models.

Before last week's announcement, engineers had already designed, built and launched the production model MX-30 e-Skyactiv R-EV in mid-2023 which uses a single-rotor rotary engine as a generator to power the SUV's electric motor. While Mazda were remaining tight-lipped about specs for this Iconic SP concept, they did reveal that it would incorporate a hybrid system similar to that of the MX-30, but that would pair an unspecified number of electric motors with a two-rotor rotary engine setup pumping out 365hp—in which that rotary engine is used solely for power generation and does not drive the rear wheels in any way.

So why make this announcement now? I feel that Mazda wanted to refocus attention on its rotary engine development, which strangely has already made its mark with the Iconic SP concept and the MX-30. I think the firm wanted to formally announce a 36-member team that has, for all intents and purposes, already created the next-generation rotary engine, or shall we call it a new rotary ‘engenerator.'

Given that the Iconic SP concept has already been revealed with its twin-rotor setup, employing its rotary engine as a generator, we can look forward to that car being launched within two years, and several other more family-oriented models as well after that.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,6,US,en,Peter Lyon,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c269374e44500c27bb4ed3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,3.8662622,fd70ff27ab92e633909ea6a7f2d10407,"['rotary engine', 'RE Development Group', 'hybrid powertrains']","Mazda has announced the rebirth of its rotary engine development team, which will focus on using rotary engines as generators to charge onboard batteries for future hybrid powertrains.",Yes,"The article discusses Mazda's plans to use rotary engines as generators for hybrid powertrains, which is relevant to the NDA's interest in supply chain risks and the development of carbon-neutral fuels.",Yellow,"{

Workplace Mental Health Failures: This Is What CEOs Need To Know,Julian Hayes II,2024-02-07 18:07:57,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/02/07/workplace-mental-health-failures-this-is-what-ceos-need-to-know/,forbes.com,Workplace mental health isn't improving despite various resources and initiatives because companies are forgetting this one simple thing.,"Mental health is a threat to individual well-being and an economic burden eroding workforce productivity, morale, and overall culture.

A joint study by the World Economic Forum and the Harvard School of Public Health forecasts a staggering $6 trillion global expenditure on mental health conditions and their related consequences by 2030, compared to $2.5 trillion in 2010. Within this context, depression alone extracts $210 billion annually from the American economy, with employers bearing half of this financial burden.

In response to a rising prevalence of mental health issues, workplace wellness has become more of a focal point. The global corporate wellness market as of 2022 was $55.5 million. However, by 2031, this market is projected to grow to $94.6 million. Yet, despite the influx of resources thrown at this problem, a growing sentiment is questioning the effectiveness of these initiatives.

Recent research published in the Industrial Relations Journal has only cast more doubt on the effectiveness of workplace wellness programs for improving mental health outcomes.

What The Study Found

This Oxford University study of more than 46,000 British employees at over 200 companies led by researcher William Fleming found that people who participate in well-being programs focusing on improving mental health got zero benefits compared to employees who don't.

The programs and well-being interventions included resilience training, mindfulness apps, and other well-being apps promoting healthy sleep habits, amongst other behaviors. Ironically, the one program that appeared to improve mental health was volunteering. Even with this, Fleming notes caution, stating that ""the estimated effects are small, probably selection-biased, and these initiatives would not engage with the job demands and resources central to theoretical and empirical understandings of work well-being.""

While this study may ring some alarms, all is not for naught. Workplace wellness programs can serve as a net positive overall. However, this study further cements one essential principle necessary to get the most out of your workplace mental health initiatives.

Sequencing Matters

Whether conquering a marathon or nurturing a fledging company into a thriving enterprise, both require a deliberate sequence of steps to get the desired outcomes. The recent study from Oxford University reminds us of the critical importance of sequencing as it pertains to designing an effective mental well-being program and an overall effective culture. This study serves as a reminder that a solid foundation must be established and nurtured before entertaining the finer details.

While mental health apps, yoga classes, massage chairs, gym memberships, and nutritional workshops undoubtedly offer benefits, they cannot compensate and cover up for a fundamental deficiency in workplace culture, leadership, and infrastructure. No wellness app or motivational talk can remedy a toxic work environment, a lack of career development opportunities, inadequate compensation, limited personal autonomy, and a disconnect from the organization's mission and purpose.

Just as a marathon runner wouldn't attempt a race without a proper foundation, companies must address the core root foundational issues before anything else. This doesn't negate the value of various wellness initiatives. Instead, it merely emphasizes the importance of strategic sequencing. Build a resilient and supportive organizational culture that supports employee well-being at its core, and then precisely add various wellness additives that complement and amplify your mission, thus ensuring organizational alignment.

Business Has Changed

The business landscape has radically shifted due to rapid technological advancements, unprecedented global events, and shifting societal norms and values. Using salary to attract and retain top talent is no longer adequate, as a 2019 Glassdoor study found over half of the 5,000 participants regarded culture as more important than salary regarding job satisfaction.

Both the Glassdoor and Oxford Study were in pre-pandemic eras, and they both serve as a reminder that the approach to workplace wellness needs to evolve to match the current times. In today's landscape, employees prioritize more than financial compensation—they seek a sense of belonging, autonomy, purpose, and fulfillment. Unsurprisingly, those ingredients improve an individual's mental health when nurtured and adhered to.",forbes.com,49,0,US,en,Julian Hayes II,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3c0c976641b5e7643c253/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,3.7578208,e0f693fa410985d082133be46209f855,"['Mental health', 'Workplace wellness', 'Well-being programs']","The article discusses the rising global expenditure on mental health conditions, the ineffectiveness of workplace wellness programs in improving mental health outcomes, and the importance of addressing foundational issues in workplace culture before implementing wellness initiatives.",Yes,"The article is relevant to the NDA as it discusses mental health, which is a key aspect of health and safety risks in the workplace.",Yellow,"{

"Source oil and gas locally, urges Equinor energy boss",Lucy Hooker,2024-02-08 00:01:02,full,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68225830,bbc.co.uk,"Countries should be prioritising energy security and sourcing locally, says the head of Norway's Equinor.","Image source,

Countries should secure supplies of oil and gas by sourcing locally, the boss of energy giant Equinor has said.
Anders Operdal told the BBC energy security should be top of the agenda after Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw supplies disrupted and prices hiked.
Equinor is the biggest investor in the Rosebank oil field in the North Sea - the largest new UK oil and gas field development in decades.
But critics say new oil fields will not make UK energy supplies more secure.
They argue a faster transition away from fossil fuels is a better strategy to ensure more stable energy prices..
Equinor is the largest investor in the Rosebank oil field in the North Sea - the largest new UK oil and gas field development in decades.
It was given the green light the day after the International Energy Agency announced that any new oil and gas developments were inconsistent with an international target of keeping the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Image caption, 
Equinor's investment in Rosebank prompted protests
But Mr Opedal defended Equinor's investment in Rosebank, pointing to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on supplies of oil and gas to Europe.
""One of the key learnings from 2022 is that energy security needs to be on top of the agenda, together with affordability and sustainability,"" he said.
""Each country needs to, I think, look harder into producing the energy they need closer to home, and that's really what we are working on to make sure we can supply Europe, the UK, with gas and oil these days and for decades to come.""
Mr Opedal said that Equinor was taking what he described as ""a balanced view"" of the transition away from fossil fuels. He said that investment in renewables would rise from its current 20% of capital expenditure to 50% by 2030.
""We are investing in Rosebank but we are also investing in Dogger Bank - the world's largest windfarm,"" he said.
""We know that, in time, demand for oil and gas will decline and we are preparing our company for that. We are investing in the energy of the future while supplying the energy the world needs now,"" he said.
However, there is a chorus of voices opposing new investment in oil and gas, arguing it makes countries less secure.
The head of the United Nations, António Guterres, said in 2022 that investment in new oil and gas was ""economic and moral madness"".
Piers Forster, the interim chair of parliament's Climate Change Committee said by contrast shifting to renewables would help keep prices stable.
""The more we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels that are sold on international markets, the less energy prices will fluctuate,"" he said.
Most oil produced in UK waters is not sold directly onto the UK market, but is traded by the private companies that extract it, with the price set by the global market. Much of the UK's North Sea gas does come into the country, but still at internationally determined prices.
Claire Fyson, from the think tank, Climate Analytics, said the UK should be cutting fossil fuel use by 6% a year rather than investing in new developments.
""Numerous studies have shown we'll have a big surplus in fossil fuels if planned projects go ahead, creating huge risks for not only the climate but also the economy,"" she said.
Mr Opedal said attacks on shipping in the Red Sea did not affect Equinor much directly, because it does not sail much oil through the waterway.
However he said geo-political events in Ukraine and the Middle East were keeping prices at a higher level.
""It's too early to say but normally all these geopolitical events keep prices at a higher level than normal supply and demand,"" he said.
He added that with Russian oil now largely redirected towards Asia, replaced in Europe by oil from Norway and Europe increasing the number of LNG terminals, there was now greater price stability than in 2022.
""I wouldn't say this is the new normal, because what is normal in an energy market? But energy is now more affordable and prices are no longer at a level where it hampers economic growth,"" he said.

‘India Out' campaigns simmer in Bangladesh amid election fallout,Faisal Mahmud,2024-02-07 07:33:27,full,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/7/india-out-campaigns-simmer-in-bangladesh-amid-election-fallout,aljazeera.com,Calls to boycott Indian goods in Bangladesh follow allegations of Indian interference in national elections.,"Dhaka, Bangladesh
 – Amid allegations of Indian interference in national elections, there's a call to boycott Indian goods in Bangladesh.


Last week, a supplier for the Indian consumer goods giant Marico faced a chilly reception in Dhaka's Panthapath area. Grocery shops, usually eager to stock their shelves with its hair oil, cooking oil, body lotion and other products, refused to take new deliveries.
list of 4 items
list 1 of 4
list 2 of 4
list 3 of 4
list 4 of 4
end of list


'Sales of Parachute oil, a Marico bestseller, have plummeted to almost zero in recent weeks,' local shopkeeper Aman Ullah said. 'Indian products just aren't moving. We're stuck with unsold stock and won't be restocking.'


Another shop owner who requested anonymity revealed a deeper reason: 'I don't want to sell Indian products any more.' He cited YouTube videos advocating a boycott of Indian goods, which he wholeheartedly supported.


Simmering anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh has boiled over in the past decade, culminating in public displays such as celebrations in Dhaka last year after India's loss in the Cricket World Cup final.


But after last month's elections in Bangladesh, in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth term while the opposition boycotted the polls, a massive 'India Out' campaign was launched, alleging Indian interference in Bangladesh politics.


The Bangladeshi diaspora and opposition groups have fuelled this anti-India movement and advocated boycotts of Indian products. This movement mirrors similar campaigns in the Maldives, where Mohamed Muizzu 
capitalized on anti-India sentiment
 to win the presidential election.


In Dhaka, the campaign was launched against the backdrop of India's traditionally strong ties with Hasina's government and its strained relationship with the opposition, leading many to believe India favoured the status quo.


Exiled Bangladeshi physician Pinaki Bhattacharya, who fled alleged government harassment in 2018, has emerged as the key figure in this burgeoning social media movement accusing India of interfering in Bangladesh's recent elections to keep Hasina in power.


Through his more than two million followers across social media platforms, Bhattacharya launched the #BoycottIndia campaign in mid-January, urging them to join 'this monumental endeavour'. His call, emphasizing love of homeland and determination to break free from perceived shackles, resonated with thousands.


The anti-India movement has surged online, 
fuelled by user-generated content
. Photos of crossed-out Indian products like Amul butter and Dabur honey are circulating alongside barcode identification tips to boycott these goods. A single post highlighting the 890 prefix used in barcodes for Indian products garnered more than 1,000 shares, showcasing the movement's online reach.


Why did the campaign gain traction?


The Indian High Commission in Dhaka declined Al Jazeera's request for a comment on this anti-India campaign.


At a Mumbai forum on January 30 with Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, attendees raised concerns about India's foreign policy amid perceived shifts in regional dynamics, particularly the growing pull of major rival China on neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and the Maldives.


Jaishankar downplayed concerns about foreign policy shortcomings but conceded the competitive reality. He pointed out that China's geographical proximity naturally grants it influence over neighbouring countries like the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
 
Screengrab from Facebook of online movements advocating boycott of Indian products


State Minister of Information and Broadcasting and lawmaker from the ruling Awami League Mohammad A Arafat, too, dismissed the concerns saying Bangladesh had received global attention because of the unprecedented fact of a fourth term for the ruling government.


'If I have to talk about other country's interest in our local politics, then the first name I would mention is the United States which even declared a Visa restriction policy based on Bangladesh election. On the other hand, India, from the very onset officially stated that Bangladesh's election is its internal matter and it has no say in it,' Arafat said.


Obaidul Quader, general secretary of Awami League told Al Jazeera that the 'India out' campaign is run by opposition parties who instead of taking part in the election blaming 'India for their misfortune.'


'They [the opposition parties] have this trump card of bashing India if anything goes against them,' said Quader, 'I don't think common people of Bangladesh support this campaign. They know that Awami League will never work against the interest of people.'


The burgeoning anti-India campaign, meanwhile, is finding traction within Bangladesh's domestic political landscape, raising concerns about potentially destabilising Bangladesh's economy and impacting regional relations.


Gono Odhikar Parishad, a rising political force aligned with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition, is promoting the boycott movement. Party leader Nurul Haque Nur declared at a recent rally in Dhaka that 'We all have to start an ‘India Out' campaign'' while alleging Indian interference in the recent elections.


Rumeen Farhana, international affairs secretary of the BNP, told Al Jazeera that the people of Bangladesh never liked India's interference in Bangladesh politics. 'It's now crystal clear that India did everything possible to keep the regime in power since 2014,' she alleged.


Resentment against India reached a boiling point in Bangladesh after Hasina's Awami League secured a resounding victory in the January 7 elections, capturing 223 seats out of 300 in parliament. Critics alleged the process lacked legitimacy due to the opposition's boycott and the presence of numerous Awami League-backed independent candidates, raising questions about the fairness of the vote.


Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered swift congratulations to both Hasina and 'the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of elections', endorsing the outcome. In contrast, Western governments expressed reservations, highlighting the boycott and the lack of a strong opposition presence.


Facebook Screengrab of calls for a boycott of Indian products in favour of Bangladeshi products


Farhana said anti-India public sentiment in Bangladesh goes beyond politics. 'The border killing, unresolved water sharing of 53 rivers including Teesta, trade deficit all play roles to that,' she said.


Around 1,276 Bangladeshis have been killed and 1,183 injured by India's border forces since 2010, according to human rights organisation Odhikar. Then there are the decades-old unresolved water-sharing agreements for 53 transboundary rivers in addition to Bangladesh's massive trade deficit with India, all of which have raised concerns about Bangladesh's sovereignty and economic independence.


Ali Riaz, distinguished professor of politics and government at Illinois State University, told Al Jazeera that India's unqualified support of the Awami League and Hasina during the 2024 elections has raised questions among many citizens about 'whether it has compromised the country's sovereignty'.


However, Sreeradha Datta, a professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs in Sonepat, India, refuted the claims of India's 'unqualified support' and said the Awami League was 'creative in going past the polls even if India [had] not agree[d] to recognise the election'.


'China and so many others congratulated PM Hasina right after the election, so would that make any difference if India didn't support it?' she asked.


The economic fallout


Analysts, meanwhile, pointed out that boycotting Indian goods could have major repercussions for the economic relationship between the two countries.


India is a major exporter to Bangladesh with annual trade historically exceeding $12bn. Additionally, Bangladesh relies heavily on India for essential commodities, and the two governments are currently in talks on an annual quota of imports of Indian farm products.


Calling the anti-India campaign a 'political stunt', Munshi Faiz Ahmed, former chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, a state-funded think tank, told Al Jazeera that the economic fallout of boycotting Indian products will be more severe for Bangladesh.


'I don't think any rational Bangladeshi would opt for taking part in this campaign. India is our neighbouring country, and we are heavily dependent on them for our everyday essentials like rice and onions. We are dependent because we get those products at the cheapest prices because of geographical proximity,' Ahmed said, adding that sourcing those products from somewhere else would cost much more.


Jyoti Rahman, an Australia-based economist told Al Jazeera that the 'India Out' movement may be politically important to the extent that 'it sends a strong message to the Indian policymakers' about growing discontent in Bangladesh but the 'economic effects are less clear cut'.


Rahman pointed out that despite being India's fourth largest export destination, Bangladesh still comprises about 3.5 percent of the Indian export market. 'Even if all exports to Bangladesh stopped, it probably wouldn't significantly affect the Indian economy as these products would find a market elsewhere,' Rahman said.


On the other hand, he said, a fifth of Bangladeshi imports are from India, including essentials such as cotton for the garment manufacturing sector, cereals and produce such as onions. '[Looking at] other sources of imports for these products could stoke inflation further,' Rahman said.


However, he highlighted the potential political effectiveness of boycotting non-essential items like tourism, cultural imports like Bollywood movies and consumer products, which he said could benefit domestic industries.


The overwhelming dependence of Bangladesh on India also means that 'Indian businesses are vulnerable if such a movement gains traction and support', Riaz said.


Even if the economic impacts are limited or not immediate, the boycotts will contribute to the public discourse on the role of India in Bangladeshi politics and highlight the unequal relationship, he said. 'This is no less important.'

Can Alibaba Grow Like It Used To In 2024?,Yue Wang,2024-02-08 11:22:20,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2024/02/08/can-alibaba-grow-like-it-used-to-in-2024/,forbes.com,"For the December quarter, the Chinese e-commerce giant reported revenue grew just 5% year-over-year, while net income plunged 70%.","06:22am EST

China's Alibaba Group Holding has seen its growth rate drop to a low single-digit again as fierce competition and broader economic woes took a heavy toll. Analysts say Alibaba, once China's largest company by market cap, is unlikely to roar back to life for the rest of 2024 because revitalization strategies are simply taking longer to show effect.

With revenue missing expectations and profit plunging 70% year-on-year for the final quarter of 2023, shares of the dual-listed e-commerce company closed 6.14% lower in Hong Kong Friday. They extended the overnight decline from New York, where the company fell almost 6%. The stock gave up earlier gains as initial enthusiasm over a new and supersized $25 billion share repurchase program soon faded.

And as China lumbers into the Year of the Dragon, Alibaba isn't starting it—nor likely to end it—with a bang.

Revenue growth at its core e-commerce unit may remain at single digits, says Wang Xiaoyan, a Shanghai-based analyst at research firm 86Research. This is because the Chinese e-commerce pioneer has been pivoting to selling lower-priced products amid cutthroat competition with upstart PDD Holdings, which at one point overtook Alibaba as China's largest e-commerce company by market value. Founded by billionaire Colin Huang, PDD, which was founded 16 years after Alibaba, has been grabbing market share by offering heavily discounted goods to China's budget-conscious shoppers amid a struggling economy.

Under a new management team that has only been in place since December, Alibaba succeeded in persuading consumers to place orders more frequently. But the average spending on each order may have come down by as much as 10%, estimates Wang, while the fees collected from merchants have been reduced in part to stop them from switching to PDD.

Yet winning back lost grounds from its fierce rivals 'won't be that fast,' says Wang. 'With the new CEO and management changes at the Taobao and Tmall Group, time is needed to integrate various resources together,' she adds.

During Thursday's analyst call, Alibaba itself pointed to 'generating synergies' from its various business units as a source of strength. The company appears to be walking back from a massive corporate overhaul announced less than a year ago, when it said that the sprawling giant would be split into six smaller business units ranging from logistics to cloud computing, and let each pursue independent fundraising opportunities.

After shelving the listing plan of its Cloud Intelligence Group, management said Wednesday that the group would continue to explore separate financing for its business units, but it isn't in a hurry given the challenging market conditions. Billionaire Joe Tsai, cofounder and chairman of Alibaba, also noted that the company is working to exit non-core investments, such as those in brick-and-mortar retail, to focus more on online commerce and cloud computing.

The company is reportedly considering selling its InTime department store unit, which was valued at $4 billion in a 2017 privatization deal led by Alibaba. While that may mark a reversal of its previous ambition to transform offline stores with technologies, analysts say the move makes sense.

'On one hand, it would allow Alibaba to concentrate its resources and strengthen its core e-commerce business, which is what it excels at,' says Kenny Ng, a Hong Kong-based securities strategist at Everbright Securities International. 'On the other hand, since the assets to be sold are currently facing losses, selling them would also be beneficial for Alibaba's short-term performance.'

Ng notes that the company may report 'more noticeable' growth in the second half of 2024, when the broader consumption market in China stands a chance of recovering if more favorable policies to stimulate demand are introduced. But conditions in the beginning of the year have been challenging, as consumer prices fell again in January to indicate persistent deflationary pressure.

Alibaba's cofounders, meanwhile, have signaled confidence in the company's long-term outlook. While reversing his previous plans to trim stakes in the e-commerce behemoth, billionaire cofounder Jack Ma recently bought about $50 million worth of company stock. Chairman Tsai separately purchased $150 million of stock around the same time.

Lyanne Alfaro Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I write about Latino entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy. Following,Lyanne Alfaro,2024-02-08 02:32:47,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lyannealfaro/2024/02/07/how-to-uplift-the-next-generation-of-latino-fund-managers/,forbes.com,"Latine business owners show significant growth. But year over year, investment numbers lag behind the trend. Organizations are setting out to close the gap.","In recent years, Latine business owners have shown significant growth. But year over year, investment numbers lag behind the trend. Average monthly business applications were 50% higher in 2021-2023 than in previous years, with nearly one quarter of all new entrepreneurs identifying as Latino, per the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, in that same year, Latinos only received 2% of venture funding. Similar representation was reflected in the number of investment partner positions held by Latinos in U.S. venture capital firms, reported as 5%, by Venture Forward, the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte.

Noramay Cadena, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at Supply Change Capital is no stranger to these stats and finding creative ways to navigate the ecosystem as a fund manager.

'When the status quo runs so deep, creativity is the only way to effect systems-level change,' she said. 'For many Latine fund managers like me, this means a reliance on being scrappy and on building partnerships that allow us to play offense our way.'

Alzar (a Spanish translation of 'uplift'). The pilot program, launched by the non-profit organization closing resource gaps for Latine founders and investors La Familia, plans to provide operational capital to qualified fund general partners investing across various industries, theses, and geographies via a $250,000 grant, in partnership with the Sorenson Impact Foundation.

'We believe that the most sustainable path to increasing access to capital for founders in our community is by dramatically increasing the number of Latine VCs and size of Latine-managed VC funds, and the best way to start is by financially supporting the best and brightest emerging Latine fund managers,' said Cheryl Campos, Co-Founder and CEO of La Familia Foundation.

Program recipients will receive grants in increments of $25,000. Provided in the program are also training resources to help recipients build operational capacity as the next generation of Latine VC fund managers, as previously reported by Forbes.

For Cadena, the Alzar grant means that her firm, which is focused on investing in food and agtech, will be able to allocate funds to on-ramp talent into venture capital.

'I've been operating at the intersection of innovation, equity, and impact for over 20 years. Whether in aerospace or deep tech or now food and agtech, my mission is to make shifts happen and to build wealth while delivering positive impact,' Cadena said.

Among the recipients of the inaugural cohort is Jason Torres, Founder and General Partner at Sana Capital, which focuses on healthcare information technology and services – both regarded as large areas of U.S. healthcare expenditures.

'We envision a future where our impact is measured not just in financial terms but also in the increased access, improved outcomes and reduced costs in healthcare,' Torres said.

Critical to its investing thesis statement is emphasizing the importance of underrepresented founders in the healthcare space. This manifests in the care available to diverse communities. In 2021, the uninsured rate for Hispanics under age 65 was 19%, per KFF, previously known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. That stat was 11% for the Black community, and 7% in White communities. Another significant disparity: While Hispanic people account for 19% of the U.S. population, only 9% of the country's health care practitioners and technicians are Hispanic, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center report.

'The most significant gaps in healthcare are often found in underserved populations. We acknowledge the systemic biases present in the industry and recognize that overlooked founders are crucial for unlocking innovative and disruptive solutions the industry needs,' he said about the talent needed to close gaps in healthcare.

Closing gaps across funders and founders is an ecosystem-wide effort. Last year, the National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), the network of diverse-owned alternative investment firms, rolled out a program in efforts to diversify fund managers, in partnership with U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance. The program was designed to engage diverse alternative asset managers, with a focus on Black and Latinx-led managers, featuring roadshows and introductions.

While the need to close the representation gap is great, performance should be a big reason why, according to general partners like Daniel Santamaria, Managing Partner at Dux Capital. Dux Capital, a recipient of the Alzar grant, is focused on investing in the next generation of Latine entrepreneurs building successful companies.

'Latinx and diverse fund managers frequently offer distinctive strategies. However, despite possessing a great track record, investors often categorize us solely as diverse fund managers, placing us with a framework that emphasizes impact over performance,' he said. 'Nevertheless, there is enough data that unequivocally demonstrates that investing in diverse fund managers consistently yield outsized returns.'

The first cohort of Alzar grantees are collectively raising $220M in capital, according to La Familia. General Partners who were named recipients are investing in fields across fintech, AI, defense, enterprise SaaS, healthcare, and impact investing, in both the US and LATAM.

'The Alzar winners have collectively 32 years of investing experience, have startup experience, have angel invested in unicorns, and have -in one case- successfully deployed a fund prior to the current,' said Campos. 'In other words, we have some serious talent for our pilot program.'",forbes.com,49,3,US,en,Lyanne Alfaro,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c43ad0f69de5d63566eef7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,3.4353836,bd14d251c4b25847764ad2197780675a,"['Latine business owners', 'investment numbers', 'Latino entrepreneurs', 'venture funding', 'Latine fund managers']","Latine business owners show significant growth, but investment numbers lag behind.

Papua New Guinea's PM to address Australian parliament as Pacific security race with China builds,Daniel Hurst,2024-02-06 14:00:37,full,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/07/png-pm-james-marape-anthony-albanese-meeting-pacific-security-china,theguardian.com,Anthony Albanese and James Marape to meet on Thursday amid rising domestic pressures on the PNG leader,"Australia will roll out the red carpet to the visiting 
Papua New Guinea
 prime minister, James Marape, amid efforts to stall China's security talks with the Pacific country.
Marape is due to arrive in Canberra on Wednesday before he addresses a joint sitting of the Australian parliament on Thursday – the first Pacific leader to be afforded this honour.
Amid increasing competition for influence in the region, the Australian government will seek to build on the security agreement with PNG that Marape and Anthony Albanese 
signed just two months ago
.
The two prime ministers will also hold an annual leaders' meeting on Thursday.
Recent reports that PNG and 
China
 have entered early talks on security and policing cooperation has alarmed Australian officials, who say Beijing is learning from its mistakes, including an ill-fated attempt by China last year to strike an overarching security and trade agreement with 10 Pacific countries at once.
The PNG government has since stressed its continued appreciation for Australia as an important 'traditional security partner'.
Marape's visit comes at a time of rising pressure at home after an outbreak of deadly unrest and violence in PNG's capital in January. That led to a string of minsters resigning and this month, Marape may face a vote of no confidence as a political process allowing MPs to challenge the PM begins on Friday.
Last month, a 
state of emergency was declared in Port Moresby
 in response to rioting and other violence in which at least 16 people were killed. Shops were set on fire and citizens robbed and assaulted after 
police and public sector workers protested over a pay cut
 that officials blamed on an administrative glitch.
Marape faced calls to resign, and at least six ministers quit in the wake of the riots. The prime minister refused to step aside, saying that the unrest was politically planned and organised and that he could only be removed on the floor of parliament, and suspended the police commissioner and other senior figures instead.

Pressure on the prime minister, who is also battling a weak economy, has continued to grow. In Papua New Guinea, prime ministers are protected from no-confidence votes for the first 18 months of their leadership; for Marape, that period expires this week.
The process to allow votes of no confidence, common in Papua New Guinea politics, begins on 9 February and runs until August.
MP Puka Temu, who recently left the government and joined the opposition, said it was 'astonishing' that Albanese would invite Marape to a state visit days before the vote of no confidence in the PNG leader was opened.
'Is Australia insensitive to PNG's domestic politics or blatantly interfering in our democratic processes?' Temu said. 'The political processes of Papua New Guinea matter. They need to be respected and not interfered with in the way Australia is currently doing.'
Marape told the Guardian the visit was scheduled last year and hit back at the opposition for playing 'politics with the PNG and Australia relationship'.
'This historic address will elevate PNG at a regional leadership level in as far as PNG's place in Pacific and the world is concerned,' Marape said.
The director of the Lowy Institute's 
Pacific islands
 program, Dr Meg Keen, said Marape would be looking to use the visit to enhance trade with Australia.

'This will be the first PM to address the parliament of any Pacific country,' Keen said.
Keen said the trip, which also includes a special dinner, showed Australia was 'doing some red carpet treatment here, as of course China has done'.
Albanese said he was 'deeply honoured' to be the 
first foreign head of government to address Papua New Guinea's national parliament
 in January last year, and it was 'fitting to invite Prime Minister Marape to do the same'.
Australia and PNG should work closely together because their security and prosperity were 'bound together', Albanese added.
Keen said Marape had indicated Australia remained 'the security partner of choice' and that he would not do anything to compromise the agreement.
'However, it's been clear from day one that these deals (US and Australia) were never exclusive deals and Marape reserves the right to pursue security deals with other countries,' Keen said.
'It's not that PNG hasn't had a long history in engaging with China on security … China has invested millions in security in PNG including vehicles and police training. China is trying to enhance that and get [closer].'
The Albanese government has bipartisan support to deepen ties with PNG.
The Coalition's foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, said Marape's visit 'should deliver meaningful progress on policies in areas such as security, climate, health and economic development'.

Rishi Sunak accused of personally holding up deal to end doctors' strikes,Denis Campbell,2024-02-06 19:09:12,full,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/06/rishi-sunak-accused-of-personally-holding-up-deal-to-end-doctors-strikes,theguardian.com,Exclusive: Sources say PM has blocked talks due to concerns about knock-on effect of more generous pay offer,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of personally holding up a deal to end doctors' strikes in England despite warnings from the health department and NHS England that waiting lists will continue to soar unless the industrial dispute is resolved.
Sources told the Guardian it had been made 'abundantly and repeatedly' clear to the prime minister that there would be no progress on his pledge to drive down 
NHS
 waiting lists until a deal was struck.
One official said Sunak had been a 'blocker' to progress during talks with both consultants and junior doctors at the end of last year because of concerns that a more generous offer would result in calls for higher pay deals across the health service, in particular for nurses.
Junior doctors staged a 
series of strikes
 after talks between the British Medical Association and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) broke down, with the doctors' union saying the government had not been able to put forward a credible offer.
Consultants, meanwhile, 
rejected the latest pay offer
 from the government by a narrow margin last month, urging ministers to improve the deal on offer. Talks between the BMA and junior ministers are continuing.
Sources told the Guardian that Sunak was warned the government would not meet waiting list targets during almost every meeting he held with NHS 
England
 and theDHSC. Downing Street aides were also told at their own meetings with health officials.
Papers marked 'official sensitive' that were sent to No 10, and have been seen by the Guardian, cautioned in bold text that 'in all scenarios if industrial action continues waiting lists will not fall'.
Sunak acknowledged on Monday that he had failed to keep his promise of cutting waiting lists, one of five key commitments he made when taking office and on which he said his own competence would be judged. The situation in England has actually worsened.
'We have not made enough progress,' he said when asked about his pledge during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, he replied: 'Yes, we have.' He later appeared to blame NHS strikes for the situation.
One source suggested that Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, had been 'reined in' by Downing Street, after initially indicating she was prepared to meet for further talks and had not yet made the government's final offer.
However, DHSC insiders said 
Atkins had only offered further talks if the strikes were called off
 first, adding that both disputes went beyond pay settlements to wider issues, including working conditions.
Whitehall sources said Steve Barclay, who was the health secretary until he moved post in the November reshuffle, pushed Sunak to settle the dispute, but was not given the autonomy to do so himself.
One senior NHS source said Atkins was being hampered by No 10 in her efforts to end the separate, but overlapping, consultants and junior doctors disputes.
'NHS England have been making it clear to the government the extent to which strikes are severely hampering efforts to get the waiting list down,' the source said.
'The Department of 
Health
 and Social Care knows that the PM's pledge won't be met unless the strikes come to an end. And while there have been some minor improvements with waiting lists, it will be impossible to make up the ground [while walkouts continue].
'It's clear from the stop-go nature of the talks between the DHSC and BMA that the secretary of state doesn't have a free hand to negotiate.'
A second well-placed NHS source said: 'NHS leaders are very clear that the delivery of [Sunak's] pledge on the elective target would be impossible without solving the strikes.
'NHS England and the Department of Health have both been arguing that if you want to meet the elective target, it will be very, very, very difficult to do that without settling the strikes by doctors.
'NHS England's leadership believes that the junior doctors' strikes and the elective target are clearly intimately related to each other.'
More than 1.3m NHS appointments in England have been rescheduled because of industrial action, according to the DHSC. Sunak has sought to blame them for the huge waiting list, which stood at 7.6m in November but fell by 96,000 that month, when there was no strikes.
Unions have consistently said ministers could avoid strikes by offering better pay deals and have denied being responsible for the waiting list, pointing out it went up by nearly 5m between 2010 and 2022, when there was no industrial action to blame.
Prof Phil Banfield, the chair of the BMA council, said: 'Doctors are already working above and beyond. If the prime minister just allowed his health secretary to make credible pay offers instead of perpetually stalling, doctors would be free to get back to bringing waiting lists down. He cannot abdicate responsibility any longer.'
Government insiders said Sunak believed every pound of taxpayers' money should be spent carefully so he was reluctant to sign off a more generous settlement.
Others said this was a false economy as the bill for NHS staffing to cover the strikes hit £2bn in early December, and is expected to rise to £3bn, more than the sum required to settle the dispute.
A DHSC spokesperson said: 'Junior doctors have been given a fair pay increase averaging 8.8%. On top of that pay increase, we have also offered further investment for junior doctors during the latest negotiations.
'If they come back to the table with reasonable expectations then we remain hopeful of finding a way forward. We want everyone to focus on patients and cutting waiting times for them, and urge the BMA to work with us in the interests of patients.'",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,"Denis Campbell,Pippa Crerar",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afe9a08df7e754835287d63a7ab2f4bb1170227/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b26e459f0aeed4c0489aed225e43dbd8,False,@guardian,3.2848332,97c10528b8abde36c9c05086b88eba76,"[""doctors' strikes"", 'waiting lists', 'NHS', 'consultants', 'junior doctors']","Rishi Sunak has been accused of holding up a deal to end doctors' strikes in England, which is impacting waiting lists and the NHS.

"Met officers investigated after black boy, 16, stopped six times in five months",Vikram Dodd,2024-02-06 17:53:54,full,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/06/met-officers-investigated-after-black-boy-16-stopped-six-times-in-five-months,theguardian.com,Police watchdog investigating eight officers after complaints of racial profiling over stops in Tottenham and Stratford,"Eight 
Metropolitan police
 officers are under investigation after a black 16-year-old was stopped six times in five months, on each occasion with nothing criminal found.
The police watchdog is investigating after the case triggered claims of racial profiling and a friend of the boy's family said he had been left traumatised.
The Guardian has learned that one stop took place outside the boy's mother's house, another outside his grandmother's house, one in a chicken shop and another by Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
Officers need reasonable suspicion to carry out stop and search and the power is used disproportionately by police against black people, and especially against young black males.
The complaint covers stops of the child between January and May 2023, five of them in Tottenham, north 
London
, and one close to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London.
The Independent Office for 
Police
 Conduct said seven officers were being investigated for potential gross misconduct – meaning that if found guilty they could be sacked – and one for alleged misconduct.
It said five of the stops had potential issues, and the complaint from the boy's mother alleged insufficient grounds for the stops, racial bias, that force was unreasonably used, that officers failed to consider the boy's welfare and that proper rules may not have been followed.
The IOPC said the grounds given by officers for the stops included suspicion of having drugs or theft, and matching descriptions of people carrying out robberies and knife crime in the area.
People who know the child say he has no criminal record.
Ken Hinds, of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group, which helped the boy and his mother make the complaint, said: 'I've known him since the age of six. He's a good kid, likes books and electronics. He's been left traumatised. When he sees a police car he wants to run away.'
Charmaine Arbouin, an IOPC director, said: 'The concerning allegations raised in the complaint – which include racial profiling of a child and insufficient grounds for stopping and searching them six times in five months – are issues that we know disproportionately affect Black and other minority ethnic communities and erode public confidence in policing. It's therefore essential that we carry out an investigation – independent of the police – to look at each of these incidents and the actions and decision-making of the officers involved.'
The news comes amid a 
race crisis for the Met
, with the group representing its own black and Asian officers calling for new police recruits to boycott the force.
That followed the Met putting the chair of the Met black police association, Insp Charles Ehikioya, before a tribunal. He could face sacking if found guilty of misconduct charges that his supporters say are trumped up and an attempt to thwart his efforts to fight prejudice in the force.
Commander Nick John, of the Met's directorate of professional standards, said: 'I understand the concern the news of this IOPC investigation will raise. Given the seriousness of these allegations, it is important that we understand exactly what has happened in each of these interactions.
'When used appropriately, stop and search powers save lives and is an important tactic to keep Londoners safe, helping us identify criminality and take dangerous weapons off our streets. We also know that when carried out incorrectly, it can have a significant impact on individuals and the wider community.'

She had finished working as a nurse, was paying off her mortgage on a property in regional Victoria and had savings in the bank.
Friends she met through a network marketing group had introduced her to an investment opportunity called 
HyperFund
 and she planned to use the returns as a source of retirement income. After initially putting in small amounts, she tipped in $80,000.
Within months, 
the money was gone
.
'I lost my house,' she says, three years later. 'I lost all my money. I couldn't pay the mortgage. I owed a lot of debts when I did actually sell the house and pay the rest of the mortgage off – by that time I didn't have much left.'
De Solieux, now 71, says she lives on a pension, which covers not much more than her rent.
'Now I haven't got five cents in the bank or in my pocket. I can't go to the dentist. I can't get my car serviced properly.
'It just goes on and on. I can't even get my [hearing] checked out. I've had friends deliver food packages on the doorstep. I have got nothing left.'
The experience left De Solieux depressed and suicidal.
'I got terribly, terribly depressed and I wanted to commit suicide. It's a terrible thing to admit to anyone, but that's that's how I felt.
'I still get up every morning and I sob, every single morning since that happened, I just can't get up without not forgiving myself and wanting to beat myself up.'
After losing $70,000, De Solieux is unable to pay for a visit to the dentist.

De Solieux is one of several Australians who lost money to the 
HyperVerse
 scheme who are joining a legal bid to recover lost money from the banks that oversaw transfers to the project.
A specialist investment fraud law firm based in the UK, Wealth Recovery Solutions, will take on De Solieux's case as one of the Australians who transferred funds to a crypto exchange to become a HyperFund member (the scheme was later rebranded as HyperVerse).
She joins more than 100 people in the UK preparing to take legal action to recover funds. WRS says it has successfully settled five HyperVerse cases in the past month, with an average value of ￡40,000 (A$77,163).
It says it has a further￡6m (A$11.6m) in active claims under way.
The move comes after the firm settled a $1m claim against National Australia Bank this month for money lost through a different, unrelated investment scheme.
A 
Guardian Australia investigation
 revealed widespread losses to the HyperVerse scheme, which was launched in December 2021 in an online promotional video featuring 
a fake chief executive officer
, Steven Reece Lewis, alongside appearances by the Australian blockchain entrepreneur Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu.
Lee 
has recently been charged
 with conspiracy to commit fraud in the US for his alleged role in HyperVerse, described in court documents as a 'pyramid and Ponzi scheme' alleged to have defrauded investors of US$1.89bn (A$2.86bn).
Josh Chinn, a solicitor, says WRS has undertaken a trace of HyperVerse funds and an associated exchange, HOO.com. It claims to have found that a group of HyperVerse accounts had received close to US$300m (A$458) on the Tron exchange alone, with 96% of these funds being sent to HOO.com. The firm says it has traced at least US$2.7bn sent to HOO.com, which it claims had links to 'between 50 and 100 known scam entities'.
HOO.com, which stands for Hyper Optimum Organization, collapsed in 2022. Guardian Australia has been unable to put questions to HOO.com whose website no longer exists.

'We firstly have to get over the hurdle of proving it's a scam,' Chinn tells Guardian Australia. 'When it comes to [alleged] cryptocurrency scams, we've got to basically prove that the [alleged] victims don't have the funds any more, so we have in-house technology where we can trace cryptocurrency.
'We are gathering together a general exhibit just to get over that first hurdle of proving it's a scam, what happened, and why the victims believed it was a genuine investment.'
Chinn says banks have an obligation under signed codes of conduct to detect any unusual activity among customers, which should trigger protective action to ensure customers do not lose funds.
This will form the basis of claims against the banks, which can be settled in liaison with the financial ombudsman without the need for litigation – which is complex, expensive and difficult. Even in the event of a successful class action, he says, a court order is unlikely to result in the recovery of funds.
'You may get a piece of paper in court that says, ‘yep that's your money, you have proven that's yours' but, at the end of the day if the third party involved, the exchange, hasn't got those funds within their remit any more, you basically have got a piece of paper that's worthless.'
De Solieux says she is pleased she can now attempt to recover her lost funds.
De Solieux says the pursuit of justice is very important to her.

'Look, it may or may not work,' she says. 'Yes, if I get my money back, that would be wonderful. But if I don't, I have to learn to live with it.'
More importantly, she says, she hopes that Lee and Xu are held to account for the losses.
'I've got to say that that's one of the things that I really care a lot about … the whole concept of justice, and people who are in these schemes they need to be brought to justice, they really do.'
Lee has denied being behind HyperVerse, saying his involvement was limited to technology provision and the funds management side of the organisation.
He did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia before the publication of a 
previous article
 about his involvement in the establishment and operation of HyperFund and HyperVerse, but has previously denied the schemes are a scam.
In a WhatsApp message after the article was published he alleged it included 'misstatements' about his role in running the Hyper schemes but did not respond when asked what they were. He also claimed that 'people on the internet continues [sic] to make things up'.
Guardian Australia has been unable to make contact with Xu for comment.

Steven Davies has had to pay for emergency dental treatment
When Stephen Davies walks around his Lancashire village of Rawtenstall he says the impact of the NHS dentistry crisis is clear for all to see.
""There are people walking around with no teeth,"" says the 67-year-old. ""I notice it amongst my friends. There's a whole generation of people with no teeth because they can't get a dentist."" 
He, like many others, has also been unable to access an NHS dentistry and has had to resort to emergency dental treatment to have 10 teeth pulled out. He ended up taking out a loan to pay for four false teeth.
""I've paid my National Insurance all my working life and I can't find a dentist. It's just not fair.""
It is a story that will be familiar across the country. 
NHS England's national patient survey
 last year found just over half of people had tried to access an NHS dentist in the past two years - with nearly a quarter of them unsuccessful.
Those who were not registered with a practice already found it the most difficult - chiming with a BBC investigation in 2022 that found nine in 10 NHS dentists were not taking on new adult patients.
Gary Tierney, 54, from Cambridgeshire, has been without an NHS dentist for four years. He says he has driven to every dentist in the area and they told him they were no longer accepting NHS patients. 
""No-one wants to take on NHS patients. Most of my upper teeth are gone, I've had to pull a few of them myself. Others are just broken and rotting, I can't afford to go private as the first thing they expect you to do is see the expensive hygienist before they will even look at the problem.""
Peter Williams is another person who has been unable to find an NHS dentist. He and his family last saw one in 2019.

Peter Williams: ""I think it is really unfair, particularly on children""
""Very soon after our dentist reopened its doors after Covid, we received a letter saying they were no longer treating NHS patients and we would have to take out a private dentistry plan or pay for our treatment.""
Despite regularly trying local dentists close to him in West Sussex, he has not been able to find one willing to take on new NHS patients.
""They either only accept private patients or their NHS slots are all full.
""It is impossible. My children are 19 and 17 and they haven't had a check-up for four years. I think it is really unfair, particularly on children.""
George Filer, 80, from South Gloucestershire, has found himself in the same position.
""I have not seen an NHS dentist now for over four years as our local dentist was taken over and now only accepts private patients.
""I have contacted the NHS for a dentist and the nearest one offered was in Basingstoke. A round trip of over 200 miles.""
He is not optimistic 
the government's new plan,
 which will see dentists offered extra payments to take on NHS patients, will work.
""It won't go anywhere. Will what the government is proposing be enough to overcome a private patient's income? I doubt it very much.""
The problems have left many resorting to having to pay for treatment privately - or giving up altogether.
The patient survey found that of the people who did not try to see an NHS dentist, half had relied on private dentistry or went without because they assumed they would not be able to find one.
Tommy Been, 28, from Berkshire, has not been able to find an NHS dentist since 2019 when he moved house.
No practices in his area are taking on new NHS patients. The closest dentist doing so is 17 miles away and neither Tommy nor his partner drive, so that option is off the table.
In September, Tommy resorted to booking a private appointment because he was suffering with toothache. His consultation and treatment for fillings including one root canal came to £1,720. 
Tommy could not afford the fee upfront, but has been able to opt for a payment plan to spread the cost.
""It's a large amount of money we can't afford. With an NHS dentist it would have been maybe a quarter of the price or a little more.""

How To Address OT And ICS Cyberattack Vulnerabilities,Christine Boles,2024-02-08 13:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/how-to-address-ot-and-ics-cyberattack-vulnerabilities/,forbes.com,This challenge of converging OT and IT requires a thoughtful assessment of the security vulnerabilities across the entire enterprise.,"Vice President Network and Edge Group, General Manager Federal & Industrial Solutions at Intel Corporation.

Production lines have always lived behind highly secure physical and digital firewalls. Keeping devices on the factory floor separate from the rest of the organization's technology ecosystem creates a security barrier that is extremely difficult to breach. However, the same security measures block organizations from bringing operations technology (OT) data into the analytics- and AI-enhanced information technology (IT) infrastructure that creates the factory of the future.

This challenge of converging OT and IT requires a thoughtful assessment of the security vulnerabilities across the entire enterprise. Because manufacturers have become a favorite target of hacks and cyberattacks—especially small and medium-sized organizations—organizations must develop a strong security position.

Newer Industry 4.0 technologies have robust cybersecurity embedded in them. However, the legacy OT and industrial control system (ICS) devices that play a large part in most production lines present three unique challenges for manufacturers:

1. OT/IT convergence opens attack opportunities for critical legacy manufacturing assets.

2. 24/7 manufacturing operations are at odds with necessary security updates and patches.

3. The growing use of remote access to OT environments creates unsecured doors.

Protect OT data by closing cyberattack portals.

Historically, manufacturing lines operated independently of corporate IT systems. The isolation brought security. It has also kept device data in separate silos. Now, as these devices come online, the IT network can unfortunately act as an entryway for potential OT security threats. If you think of each OT device as a possible cyberattack portal, you can see the importance—and complexity—of securing OT data.

When your security team inventories the OT device ecosystem, there is an opportunity to see the vulnerabilities more clearly. Older devices lack strong, multifactor authentication. According to a report from Rockwell Automation, ""In more than half of OT/ICS incidents, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems are targeted recording 53 percent, with PLCs (programmable logic controllers) as the next most common targeted at 22 percent."" It's why CISA and NSA have both issued advisories warning about PLC targeting.

Once the devices are identified, security can take many forms. Adding stronger passwords and encryption will immediately provide more secure communications with older devices. However, replacing these devices with ones that have modern security certifications and credentials should be the ultimate goal. These devices provide extensive security at the silicon and software level. If upgrading devices needs to be done in stages, your security team should alert stakeholders to the potential vulnerabilities at all stages of the upgrade plan.

OT data is essential to keeping production lines running, blocking supply chain disruptions and protecting your company's IP. Proactively protecting the portals that open your production lines to cyberattacks should be a top priority.

Complete software security updates with minimal line disruption.

Taking a production line offline to perform security updates or patches can be risky for two reasons. The disruption negatively impacts production, and it introduces a potentially disastrous disruption to the larger manufacturing system. Add to this the lack of modern security standards and protocols of older machines, and you get unidentified security challenges that can cause a chain reaction that shuts down a plant for an unknown amount of time. The disruptions can extend beyond the factory floor. One study notes that 65% of cyber incidents impacted the broader supply chain.

There are multiple approaches to address this challenge. You may be able to schedule updates when lines are not running. Security teams can limit the scope of upgrades and test the software thoroughly before deploying it. Numerous cloud-based tools also provide various security protocols during software updates. Whatever solutions you choose, ensure communication lines with all stakeholders are in place and use them to keep the information flowing between teams.

Seal off security gaps specific to remote access devices.

Remote access is a double-edged sword. Access to data from anywhere at any time has become a fundamental expectation of our work culture. However, it also opens unintended security gaps extending to the factory floor.

Remote work introduces attack portals. Hybrid workers access organizational networks with phones and remote PCs from remote and possibly unsecured offices. Permitting vendor and service provider access introduces additional vulnerabilities. In the manufacturing world, wireless IoT devices function as remote devices. The heterogeneous nature of the remote ecosystem is inherently challenging to protect.

Balancing remote work with security is most successful when IT adopts a zero-trust approach where every device outside of its control is considered hostile. Identifying all access points—internal and external wireless devices—is the first step in closing these security gaps.

Policymakers join the cybersecurity landscape.

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president said, ""If everything is connected, everything can be hacked."" The debilitating consequences on economics, national security and safety are changing how governments develop cybersecurity policies. Two pieces of legislation stand out because of their impact on the manufacturing industry:

• The European Union Cyber Resilience Act —approved in early December 2023—requires any hardware or software connecting directly or indirectly to another device or network to meet robust cybersecurity requirements. Devices or software not meeting the requirements will not make it to market.

• The U.S. Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act requires all IoT devices controlled or owned by federal agencies to meet security requirements.

IoT devices or software with substandard security will disappear, providing consistent and stronger cybersecurity for consumers. However, for manufacturers developing the devices—or manufacturers using IoT devices in the equipment they sell within the EU or the U.S.—understanding and meeting the new standards will be crucial to their business.

Build a secure factory of the future.

The digitization of factories has enabled us to improve efficiency, productivity, creativity and safety. However, it also introduces a level of complexity when it comes to securing devices and data against cybersecurity attacks.

Security, when done with thoughtful planning, builds the foundations for a secure and safe factory of the future. While no system is 100% safe, working with your security team to mitigate known risks can harden the overall security of a manufacturing ecosystem and reduce the risk of a cyberattack.

Online Review Trends Affecting Today's Consumers,Michael Podolsky,2024-02-08 14:30:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/08/online-review-trends-affecting-todays-consumers/,forbes.com,Keeping a close eye on what's being said in online reviews can help brands better understand the customer perspective.,"Cofounder and CEO of PissedConsumer, a review platform that helps consumers be heard and brands improve their customer service processes.

Online reviews have become integral in many consumers' decision-making processes. With so much faith now being placed in peer recommendations, it's no surprise that many consumers read reviews before making a purchase.

Having worked closely with businesses to understand and work with customer feedback, I've seen firsthand how critical review management can be. Taking account of evolving consumer trends and behaviors is an important part of developing strategies to ensure your business is meeting customer satisfaction standards. To that end, let's look at some statistics from recent consumer surveys that reveal consumer review trends.

An online review survey by my company focusing on the tangible benefits of customer feedback found that a remarkable 75.5% of consumers put their trust in online reviews when making a purchase decision. On top of that, BrightLocal research revealed that 49% of consumers trust reviews as much as they would a direct recommendation from their friends or family. This level of faith shows that consumers now largely depend on the opinions and experiences of their peers, online even more so than offline, when choosing between brands. With the purchase likelihood for a product with five reviews being 270% greater than that of a product with no reviews, businesses simply cannot overlook the weight that online reviews carry.

Negative Reviews And Their Impact

The negative review is the threat that strikes fear into reputation-conscious brands. While bad feedback is not the be-all and end-all, and can sometimes even be turned around to one's advantage, the impact of poor feedback that's visible to all is undeniable. Left unaddressed, even a solitary scathing review followed by a handful of less-than-complementary testimonials can be enough to put many buyers off.

No company, no matter the size, is immune to the issues that can come with public negative customer reviews—even if it's a large online retailer. For instance, Amazon fields a high volume of customer service inquiries and gets a large share of online complaints. While their scale means they are well-positioned to identify weak links in their operation and implement broad solutions, maintaining a positive reputation grows more challenging as online interactions increase, and even minor mistakes can go viral if not addressed properly.

Evading Criticism

A worrying trend that is coming to light is the coercive tactics that some companies are resorting to in an attempt to massage their review scores. The online review survey by my company also found that 14.8% of those surveyed have reported being threatened by companies demanding the removal of negative reviews. Whilst incentivization to leave a review is just, penalizing the customer for not removing or editing a critical review is a very bad move, ethically and reputationally. Further antagonizing reviewers through such demands only compounds existing issues by making a brand appear insecure or deceptive.

Learning From Online Reviews To Strengthen Your Brand

My experience has shown me how vital it can be for businesses to proactively monitor and engage with their online reviews. Cast aside any notions that reviews have negligible impact and thus can be ignored. Instead of digging the hole further, consider ways you can make online reviews—positive and negative—work for your business. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Respond to all reviews.

Acknowledging each review, whether it be one star or five, shows customers you are paying attention. Promptly and thoughtfully address problematic reviews to reassure potential customers. Address problems sincerely, and thank reviewers for the time they took out of their day to provide you with useful feedback. Non-responses can breed mistrust and suggest to prospective buyers that when/if the time comes, their issues will also be ignored.

2. Empower your frontline staff.

Customer service is your brand's first point of contact with its clients/customers. Equipping your CS team to confidently and swiftly identify, document and solve complaints can help stop small frictions from escalating into public retaliation through damning reviews.

Here, training is an important tool. Give your CS staff clarity and confidence in company products, processes and procedures, as well as the leeway to think laterally to devise unique solutions to particular customer problems. I also recommend bringing onboard AI assistance to help divert the more rudimentary inquiries away from your human staff, giving them more time to put their minds to trickier or more sensitive customer complaints.

• Gather customer insights.

Monitoring feedback and online review trends can provide a wealth of knowledge on pain points, preferences and data on different customer groups. This data can be put to work to refine your operation, your products and your service standards. What's more, keeping an eye open for patterns across positive and negative feedback can allow you to get the jump on emerging issues and take action to cool down potentially heated situations before they boil over.

Using Review Management For Long-Term Success

Ultimately, trust in a brand is easily lost if the connection between the company and the customer fails. Both sides can benefit from active communication, and honest customer reviews, positive and negative, are important to maintaining a strong brand reputation.

Keeping a close eye on what's being said in online reviews and identifying patterns in online review statistics can help your brand better understand the customer perspective. You can then put proactive strategies in place to eliminate problem areas and smooth out any stumbling blocks in the customer journey. With a sensitive and solution-oriented approach to handling reviews, you can build up your reputation and gain not only valuable, actionable insights but also advocates for your brand.",Copyright 2024 Forbes Media LLC,49,1,US,en,"Council Post,Forbes Councils Member,Michael Podolsky",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c3a666297e0a71bd658ed9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,False,@forbes,,064dec568701b1f2aa5361e0878ba7cf,"['online reviews', 'customer feedback', 'negative reviews', 'review management', 'brand reputation']","Online reviews have become integral in consumers' decision-making processes, with 75.5% of consumers trusting online reviews when making a purchase decision.

Here is a timeline of key moments along the way","Labour's pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment is to be ditched, two and a half years after it was announced to cheering party members as an eye-catching flagship policy.
It has been at the centre of a public and private struggle since it was announced, with factions inside Labour arguing against moves to water it down.
The 
decision on Thursday
 is to be defended on the basis of uncertainty about public finances as Labour moves to finalise its election manifesto. Nevertheless, voices from different sections of the party and from business are mourning a failure of ambition.
Following are some of the key moments leading up to this point.
27 September 2021
Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, 
pledges to become the UK's first 'green chancellor'
 and invest £28bn a year for the rest of the decade, in front of cheering Labour members at the party's conference in Brighton.
23 September 2022
Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous mini-budget
 leads to what is later estimated to be a £30bn fiscal black hole, setting the scene for a recalibration of Labour's own spending plans and pledges.
9 June 2023
Labour scales back plans
 to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry. Citing the poor economic backdrop and interest rate rises since the Truss mini-budget, Reeves delays plans for a green prosperity fund to start in the first year of a Labour government.
31 January 2024
A pushback against plans to water down the pledge gathers pace among leading economists and business experts. Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens and a figure advising Labour on transport and infrastructure, describes £28bn a year as an 'absolute minimum'.
1 February 2024

Christian Horner's F1 future at stake in crucial Friday meeting with investigator,Giles Richards,2024-02-08 14:18:50,full,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/08/christian-horners-f1-future-at-stake-in-crucial-friday-meeting-with-investigator,theguardian.com,Red Bull team principal will defend himself against claims of inappropriate controlling behaviour in London interview with barrister leading investigation,"Christian Horner's future in Formula One hangs in the balance as the Red Bull team principal prepares for a crunch meeting on Friday where he must defend himself against allegations of inappropriate behaviour that might end his career.
On Friday at an undisclosed location believed to be in central London, Horner will sit down with an English KC, appointed by 
Red Bull
 Racing's parent company, the drinks manufacturer Red Bull GmbH, and face questioning on the allegations made by a female employee that he used what is understood to have been described as 'controlling' behaviour in his interactions with her.

The employee is believed to have already presented her evidence, which includes physical documentation, to the barrister and Horner now must make his case to save his job and his career. He has taken legal representation and intends to defend himself robustly.
Horner has already emphatically denied any wrongdoing but must now provide substantive arguments to verify his claim. It will be as intense and as crucial a moment as he has faced in 20 years in F1.
The 50-year-old is the longest serving team principal currently working in the sport, having been taken on by Red Bull when the team entered the sport in 2005. He is also, alongside Mercedes' Toto Wolff, one of the two most successful principals of the modern era. Whether there are further achievements ahead and the nature of the legacy he leaves will now depend on what he can present to the barrister heading the inquiry on Friday.
Since the news broke that Horner was under investigation it has dominated F1, far overshadowing this week's series of car launches for the 2024 season. It took Horner as much by surprise as the rest of the paddock when Red Bull Racing's parent company announced on Monday it had opened an investigation into the team principal and was unequivocal that it had every intent to deal with the matter properly.
'After being made aware of certain recent allegations, the company launched an independent investigation,' it said in a statement. 'This process, which is already under way, is being carried out by an external specialist barrister. The company takes these matters extremely seriously and the investigation will be completed as soon as practically possible. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.'
The female employee has not been named nor any details of her complaint made public, other than that the behaviour in question was 'controlling' in nature, indicating it was likely an employee with whom Horner must have had personal interaction. Red Bull Racing have made no formal comment since the announcement and Horner too has not commented beyond the statement that 'I completely deny these claims' he made on Monday.

Red Bull are set to launch their 2024 car on Thursday of next week and the hope within the team is that the matter is resolved before then. It is understood no decision will be announced immediately after the meeting but that the KC will consider the evidence of their inquiry over the weekend before delivering his conclusions to Red Bull.
Rumour and conjecture have surrounded the case since it began, amplified by the lack of comment and information coming from either Red Bull Racing or the parent company while the investigation is under way.

However supporters of Horner have indicated that he has been left shocked and disturbed by what they believe to have been a power struggle over the team that lies behind the investigation. They consider it an attack from Austria by the parent company, with one source describing it as an effort to 'clip his wings or remove him from the job altogether'.
Horner's allies argue that the inappropriate behaviour defined as 'controlling' in nature was not aggressive or bullying and that perception of his actions will be key in making his case.
The 50-year-old occupies an unusual position in F1 in that he is not only the team principal of Red Bull Racing but also the CEO of all three of its arms: Red Bull Racing, Red Bull Powertrains and Red Bull Advanced Technologies. He controls the business side as well as the sporting operation.
Before the death of the founder of Red Bull, Dietrich Mateschitz, in October of 2022 the owner was happy to leave Horner running the entire show. This is believed to have changed with the appointment of Oliver Mintzlaff as managing director. Mintzlaff is reportedly being considered as a potential replacement for Horner.
Supporters argue that the motivation behind the parent company's handling of the situation is an attempt to destabilise Horner in order to potentially remove him. Red Bull GmbH have yet to comment on this interpretation.
Horner has reigned over a period of extraordinary success for Red Bull racing as they have won six constructors' world championships and seven drivers' titles. They have dominated the past two seasons with an exceptional car and driver, in the form of Max Verstappen, buta sudden change of management or of team principal would leave the team reeling with the new season set to begin in Bahrain on 2 March.",theguardian.com,60,0,GB,en,Giles Richards,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63bfd60978d69cf2969cab220cd3496987c64c74/0_117_5469_3280/master/5469.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90d355638ceba1c075a0dff07b0230d5,False,@guardian,,bca52fe773b0f44b8d7175d66b535645,"['Christian Horner', 'Red Bull', 'allegations', 'inappropriate behaviour', 'investigation']","Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, faces allegations of inappropriate behavior and is under investigation.

Paul Givan: DUP education minister wants to close gap on pay,Brendan Hughes,2024-02-08 14:14:46,full,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68241380,bbc.com,Education Minister Paul Givan's first official engagement is to a Catholic grammar school in Belfast.,"Image source,

Stormont's new education minister has said he plans to meet teaching unions next week to discuss calls for better pay.
Paul Givan said he wanted the ""gap to close"" between wages for school staff in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in Great Britain.
He was speaking as he visited a Catholic grammar school in Belfast.
It was the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member's first official ministerial engagement.
In January teaching and non-teaching staff were among the thousands of public sector workers who joined 
Northern Ireland's biggest strike for decades
, calling for better pay and conditions.
The UK government has offered funding to settle public sector pay disputes, but Stormont parties say more money is needed.
Mr Givan said resolving the industrial dispute was his top priority.
""We need to have teachers and non-teachers being properly rewarded for the excellent work that they carry out,"" he said.
Asked if there would be pay parity between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, he said: ""Well, when it comes to closing that gap, I want the gap to close.""
He said he would be ""making the case"" for pay increases but acknowledged there would be ""constraints"" on the level of funding available to the new power-sharing executive, which was 
restored last week following a two-year hiatus.
Mr Givan said he would consider introducing legislation to curb the costs of school uniforms.
But he did not commit to introducing a cap - a measure the DUP said it supported in its 2022 assembly election manifesto.
""The uniform issue is something that I do want to take forward,"" he said.
""I'll be discussing with officials if a legislative solution is required. We do have very clear guidance whenever it comes to uniform policy that schools should be taking into account.
""But clearly if the guidance isn't being followed, then I need to look at other alternatives to that.""

Mr Givan also said schools should not be used for ""cultural wars"" or as a place to ""further political ideologies"".
He was speaking about a DUP campaign he supported objecting to changes introduced at Westminster last year to relationships and sex education (RSE) in Northern Ireland.
The new regulations 
make it compulsory
 for all post-primary schools in Northern Ireland to teach pupils about access to abortion and prevention of early pregnancy.
In a social media post in 2023, Mr Givan said ""radicals"" were seeking to use the changes to ""bring forward their woke agenda"".
On Thursday, Mr Givan said the move was ""disrespecting the devolution settlement"".
He said the DUP campaign objecting to RSE changes was about ensuring ""our school environment doesn't become a place for cultural wars to take place"".
Mr Givan's first official visit as education minister was to Rathmore Grammar School - a Catholic school on the outskirts of west Belfast.
The DUP assembly member for Lagan Valley said he was ""sending out a very clear statement that I'm here to be a minister for everybody in Northern Ireland"".
On Wednesday, the new minister also signalled his support for the Special Educational Needs (SEN) sector, saying children with special needs ""should be getting the same education as any other child in mainstream education"".
But speaking on the BBC's Nolan Live programme, Mr Givan said the sector faced a ""real pressure-point in terms of capacity"".
""Even this year alone the department has spent £30m more than what was anticipated in emergency provision and trying to enhance the capacity,"" he said.
""And going forward, this is going to continue to rise in terms of the numbers, and I'm not talking about hundreds. 
""Over the next 10 years the numbers of children that we're projected that is going to need special support is going to rise by thousands and therefore there is a real challenge.""
In 2022-23 more than 10,000 children received SEN provision in Northern Ireland but figures show a pattern of rising demand.
That meant 853 additional pupil places were required in special schools and 400 places were needed in specialist classes within mainstream schools.
